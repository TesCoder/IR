# “Why School?” Essay Checklist (IvyReady)

Use this checklist right before you submit each “Why Us / Why School” supplement.

## 1) Thesis (1–2 sentences)
- [ ] Thesis states what I want to study/explore.
- [ ] Thesis states what environment I’m seeking (and why).

## 2) Academic fit (2–3 specifics)
- [ ] I included 2–3 academic specifics (classes, sequences, labs, institutes, programs, capstones).
- [ ] Each detail answers “so what?” (what I’ll do with it).
- [ ] At least one detail is a “bridge” detail that connects to my past work/track record.

## 3) Community fit (1–2 specifics)
- [ ] I included 1–2 community specifics (orgs, service programs, LLCs, mentorship pathways, leadership tracks).
- [ ] I tied them to what I’ve already done (now scaled at this school).

## 4) Close (contribution + forward motion)
- [ ] I ended with what I’ll bring and how I’ll show up.
- [ ] My ending has forward motion (a concrete plan).

## Anti-generic check
- [ ] If I swap the school name, the essay no longer works.
- [ ] I removed rankings/prestige language.
- [ ] I avoided laundry lists (fewer details, explained well).
