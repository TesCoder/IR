For international transfer students, the application isn’t finished when you’re admitted. You still have a second timeline: **financial proof, I-20/DS-2019 steps, visa scheduling, and housing deposits** — often with tight windows.

This guide gives you a clear sequence, acceptable document formats, and common pitfalls so you can plan ahead and avoid last-minute delays. Always confirm details with your school’s international office and official government resources.

## Timeline — request your new I-20 early
- Start 8–12 weeks before term if possible; earlier if your country has limited visa slots.
- Confirm deposit deadlines, international office processing time, and any portal-specific tasks.
- Upload passport, proof of funds, and enrollment intent promptly so the school can issue your I-20/DS-2019.

## Acceptable Financial Documents (proof-of-funds)
- Bank statements on letterhead (dated within 60 days) showing available balance and currency.
- Sponsor letter naming the student, relationship, amount committed, and contact info.
- Scholarship/assistantship letters with amount and duration.
- If using multiple accounts/sponsors, include translations and currency conversion notes.
**Bank letter template:** account holder name, average balance over past X months, statement date, bank contact info, official signature/stamp.

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them
- Stale or unsigned statements → refresh within 60 days and include signatures/stamps.
- Missing passport details → upload a clear, valid passport biographic page with the statement.
- Currency conversion gaps → annotate USD equivalent with date and source (XE/OANDA).
- Delayed visa appointments → check appointment availability weekly and keep a backup location if possible.

## What to do after transfer: SEVIS, travel, and re-entry tips
- After your transfer, confirm SEVIS transfer/activation steps and travel signatures with your international office.
- Keep I-20/DS-2019, financial proof, and enrollment evidence accessible when traveling.
- Maintain full-time enrollment and report address changes per your school’s instructions.
