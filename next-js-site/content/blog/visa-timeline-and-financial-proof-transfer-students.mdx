For international transfer students, the application isn’t finished when you’re admitted.

You still have a second timeline that can move fast: **financial proof, immigration documents (often I-20/DS-2019 depending on program), visa steps, housing logistics, and deposit deadlines.**

This guide gives you a practical sequence so you can plan ahead and avoid avoidable delays.

Note: This is general education, not legal advice. Visa and immigration processes vary; always confirm with your school’s international office and official government resources.

## The goal: avoid “everything at once”

The risk period is often the gap between:

- getting admitted, and
- finalizing finances + immigration documents + housing

Planning early helps you avoid overlap stress (especially if multiple schools have deposit timelines).

## A practical post-admit timeline

### Step 1: Confirm what the school needs from you (immediately)
After admission, confirm:

- Deposit deadlines
- Financial proof requirements
- International office process and timelines
- Housing and enrollment deadlines

### Step 2: Prepare financial proof documents (before you’re asked)
Schools commonly request documentation that shows:

- Available funds to cover costs
- Source of funds (sponsor, family, scholarship)
- Consistency and legitimacy of documentation

Even when requirements differ, the best practice is to keep documents organized and ready.

### Step 3: Request your immigration document on time
Once the school has what it needs, it can begin generating your immigration document (commonly I-20; some programs use DS-2019).

This step can be slowed by:

- incomplete financial documents
- missing passport details
- delays responding to requests

### Step 4: Build buffer for visa appointment timing
Visa appointment availability varies. The only safe assumption is that you need buffer.

### Step 5: Plan deposits and housing with your financial strategy
International transfers sometimes face overlapping deadlines across schools. Track:

- deposit dates
- refund policies
- housing deposit requirements

Avoid committing deposits impulsively without understanding the financial implications.

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Mistake: waiting until admission to organize financial proof.**  
  **Fix**: prepare a folder now; update as needed.

- **Mistake: missing deadlines because they’re on a different portal.**  
  **Fix**: maintain one calendar with reminders.

- **Mistake: treating visa steps as “later.”**  
  **Fix**: start planning the week you’re admitted.
