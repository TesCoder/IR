For international transfer students, the application isn’t finished when you’re admitted. You still have a second timeline: **financial proof, I-20/DS-2019 steps, visa scheduling, and housing deposits** — often with tight windows.

This guide gives you a clear sequence, acceptable document formats, and common pitfalls so you can plan ahead and avoid last-minute delays. Always confirm details with your school’s international office and official government resources (this is general information, not legal advice).

Use this page if you’re an international transfer student who needs a clear plan for I-20/DS-2019 steps, proof-of-funds documents, and any visa scheduling.

By the end, you’ll have a simple timeline to follow, a short document checklist, and the pitfalls that cause last-minute delays.

## Quick checklist (10-minute pass)
- Confirm your school’s international office processing time and required portal steps.
- Ask whether you need a **SEVIS transfer**, a **new visa appointment**, or both (your international office can tell you).
- Prepare your passport biographic page + proof-of-funds package (and sponsor letter, if applicable).
- Track deadlines in one place: I-20/DS-2019 request, housing, orientation/check-in, tuition payment.
- If you’ll need a visa appointment, check availability weekly and keep a backup location if possible.

<span id="timeline"></span>
## Timeline — Request your new I-20 early

Use this as a default sequence (adjust for your school, country, and status):

1. **8–12+ weeks before term (earlier if visa slots are limited)**: Confirm deposit deadlines, international office processing time, and any portal-specific tasks.
2. **As soon as you can**: Complete any steps required before the school can issue your I-20/DS-2019 (often an intent form and/or enrollment deposit).
3. **Submit your I-20/DS-2019 request packet**: Upload passport + proof-of-funds documents promptly (and any school-specific forms).
4. **During processing**: Monitor your portal/email for missing-item requests and respond quickly.
5. **When you receive your I-20/DS-2019**: Check details (name, DOB, program, start date). Request corrections immediately if anything is wrong.
6. **If you need an appointment**: After you receive your I-20/DS-2019, follow your embassy’s checklist (commonly: DS-160, required fees, interview booking). Schedule your interview early and plan housing/travel around the timeline.
7. **Arrival + check-in**: Follow your school’s instructions for orientation/check-in, address updates, and SEVIS activation/transfer completion.

<span id="transfer-notes"></span>
## Transfer-specific notes (before you schedule anything)
- **I-20 vs DS-2019**: an **I-20** is for **F-1** status; a **DS-2019** is for **J-1** status. Your school will tell you which document applies to you.
- **SEVIS transfer release date matters**: if you’re already in the U.S. on F-1/J-1, your current school typically needs to “release” your SEVIS record to the new school on a specific date. Ask both schools what they need and when.
- **Visa stamp vs status**: many students can stay in the U.S. and maintain status without a new visa appointment, but you may need a valid visa stamp to re-enter after travel. If you’re outside the U.S. (or plan to travel) and your visa is expired, plan extra time for an appointment. Requirements vary—confirm with your international office and official government sources.

<span id="visa-appointment"></span>
## Do you need a new visa appointment? (common scenarios)

This varies by country and situation — confirm with your international office. But these patterns are common:

| Situation | Usually means | Plan for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **In the U.S., transferring SEVIS, not traveling internationally** | You may **not** need a new visa appointment right away | Focus on SEVIS release date + check-in/activation steps |
| **In the U.S., but you plan to travel and your visa stamp is expired** | You’ll likely need a **new visa stamp** to re-enter | Extra time for appointment availability + administrative processing risk |
| **Outside the U.S. at the time of transfer/start** | You’ll typically need to follow your embassy’s visa process | Book early after your new I-20/DS-2019 is issued |
| **Changing status type (F-1 ↔ J-1)** | Document + requirements can change | Ask what form (I-20 vs DS-2019), fees, and timelines apply |

If you’re unsure, ask one question: **“Am I changing status, or just transferring my SEVIS record?”**

<span id="financial-documents"></span>
## Acceptable financial documents (proof of funds)
Exact requirements vary by school (and sometimes by status/country). Follow your admitting school’s instructions first.

- Official bank statements or bank letters (recent—often within the last 60–90 days; confirm your school’s requirement) showing available balance and currency.
- Sponsor letter naming the student, relationship, amount committed, and contact info.
- Scholarship/assistantship letters with amount and duration.
- If using multiple accounts/sponsors, include translations and currency conversion notes and consider adding a 1-page cover note that totals funds and explains relationships.

**If your school asks for a bank letter, it usually needs**:
- Account holder name (student or sponsor)
- Statement date and currency
- Current balance (and/or average balance over past X months, if requested)
- Bank contact info
- Official signature/stamp (if your school requires it)

## When you receive your I-20/DS-2019: a 2-minute verification checklist

Before you book anything expensive, quickly verify:

- Legal **name spelling** matches your passport
- **Date of birth** is correct
- **School + program** are correct
- **Start date** (and level) match what you accepted
- **Funding** listed meets the school’s stated requirement (and your scholarship letter matches)
- For transfers: the **SEVIS transfer release date** matches what both schools agreed on

If anything is wrong, request a correction immediately — small errors can become big delays later.

<span id="questions"></span>
## Questions to ask your international office (copy/paste)

Send a short email with these (edit as needed):

- What is your typical **I-20/DS-2019 processing time** after I submit all documents?
- Do you require a **deposit/intent form** before you can issue the document?
- For my situation, do I need a **SEVIS transfer**, a **new visa appointment**, or both?
- What **SEVIS transfer release date** should I request from my current school?
- Do I need to pay any **fees** again (and if so, which ones)?
- What proof-of-funds **formats** do you accept (bank letter vs statement; how recent)?
- What is the **earliest arrival date** and the check-in/orientation procedure?
- If something is marked “missing” in the portal, what’s the fastest way to resolve it?

<span id="common-pitfalls"></span>
## Common pitfalls (and how to avoid them)
- Stale or unofficial statements → refresh within your school’s required window (often 60–90 days) and submit official PDFs/letters; add signatures/stamps only if your school requests them.
- Name mismatches → make sure passport, sponsor letter, and bank documents use the same legal names (and explain any differences).
- Missing passport details → upload a clear, valid passport biographic page with the statement.
- Currency conversion gaps → annotate USD equivalent with date and source (XE/OANDA).
- Delayed visa appointments → check appointment availability weekly and keep a backup location if possible.

<span id="after-transfer"></span>
## After transfer: SEVIS, travel, and re-entry tips
- After your transfer, confirm SEVIS transfer/activation steps and travel signatures with your international office.
- Keep I-20/DS-2019, financial proof, and enrollment evidence accessible when traveling.
- Maintain full-time enrollment and report address changes per your school’s instructions.

Travel packet idea (keep digital + printed if possible):
- Passport + visa stamp (if applicable)
- I-20/DS-2019 (latest version) + travel signature if required
- Proof-of-funds snapshot + scholarship/assistantship letter (if relevant)
- Enrollment confirmation / class schedule
