Extracurriculars are where your application stops being theoretical. Your transcript tells an admissions reader what you *can* do in a classroom. Your activities show what you *choose* to do when no one is grading you.

This hub is a practical, “do this next” guide to building an extracurricular and leadership plan that supports your narrative, fits your schedule, and produces outcomes you can document. Use it whether you’re a sophomore trying to get organized or a senior trying to make sense of a crowded activities list.

## What strong extracurriculars actually prove
At highly selective schools, activities aren’t about collecting clubs. They’re evidence of three things:

1. **Direction**: you have interests that are becoming more specific (not just “I like everything”).  
2. **Contribution**: you make something better — a team, a program, a community, a research group.  
3. **Follow-through**: you stick with hard things long enough to generate results.

You can prove those through school-based leadership, community impact, paid work, family responsibilities, sports, research, creative work, or a passion project. The “best” activity is the one you can *sustain* and *measure*.

## The IvyReady approach: build an activities plan backwards
Instead of asking “What do top students do?”, start with constraints and outcomes:

- **Time reality**: How many hours per week can you commit without harming grades, sleep, or health?
- **Story clarity**: What are 1–2 themes you want an AO to remember about you?
- **Outcome targets**: What can you *ship* in 8–12 weeks that creates proof (a result, a role, a deliverable)?

When you plan backwards from outcomes, your activities list becomes coherent — and your leadership looks earned.

## Quick start: a simple plan by grade
### 9th–10th grade (build breadth, then pick)
- Explore 2–4 interest areas and keep the ones you’d do even if no one rewarded you.
- Start tracking outcomes early (hours, participants served, funds raised, attendance growth, performance metrics).
- Identify one activity where you can *own a piece* (not necessarily a title).

### 11th grade (build depth and proof)
- Choose a primary focus and design a progression: contributor → owner → leader.
- Add one “impact project” with measurable milestones.
- Collect “receipts” as you go (screenshots, numbers, letters, links) so your future activities bullets are easy.

### 12th grade (package and present)
- Audit your list for redundancy and weak items.
- Rewrite bullets to show outcomes, leadership, and scale.
- If you’re starting something new late, make it *small but shippable* — avoid vague “initiatives.”

## A simple self-audit (10 minutes)
Take your current activities list and score each item 0–2 on the questions below:

- **Impact**: Did something change because you showed up?  
- **Ownership**: Did you own a process, a deliverable, or a result?  
- **Duration**: Did you stay long enough to build skill and trust?  
- **Selectivity**: Did you earn your spot or compete for it (when relevant)?  
- **Evidence**: Can you prove it with numbers, outcomes, or a concrete artifact?

Your goal is not perfect scores. Your goal is to identify which activities deserve more time — and which ones should be trimmed or reframed.

## Common mistakes (and quick fixes)
- **Mistake: chasing titles.**  
  **Fix**: pursue ownership. A “project lead” with outcomes often reads stronger than a “VP” with none.

- **Mistake: too many small activities.**  
  **Fix**: consolidate. Keep what supports your narrative and cut what doesn’t add new information.

- **Mistake: vague impact (“helped”, “assisted”).**  
  **Fix**: rewrite with verbs + scope + outcome: “trained 6 volunteers; increased weekly attendance from 12→28.”

- **Mistake: starting a passion project too big.**  
  **Fix**: ship a Version 1. A small, completed project beats an ambitious, unfinished idea.

## If you want a tighter plan
If you’re unsure which activities to prioritize (or how to build proof fast), a short strategy call can clarify what to keep, what to drop, and what to build next.
