College interviews are rarely about “getting the right answer.” They’re about reducing uncertainty.

An interviewer is trying to confirm a few things quickly: **Can you communicate clearly? Do you reflect like a real person? Do you seem like someone who will show up well in a classroom, team, or dorm community?** Your goal is to be memorable for the right reasons — calm, specific, and grounded.

This hub helps you prepare without turning into a robot.

## The three buckets interviewers usually evaluate
Even when the format varies, most interviews test:

1. **Clarity**: Can you answer the question directly and stay on track?
2. **Substance**: Do you have real experiences and learning, not just labels?
3. **Fit**: Do you understand what you’re applying for and why it matches how you work?

Notice what’s missing: no one is grading you on fancy vocabulary.

## What “good prep” looks like (and what it doesn’t)
Good prep means:

- You can tell your story in 60–90 seconds without rambling.
- You have 3–5 proof points ready (impact, leadership, growth, curiosity).
- You’ve practiced answering common questions with a structure (not memorized lines).
- You have 2–3 thoughtful questions about the school that are *not* on the homepage.

Bad prep is writing a script and trying to perform it. Scripted answers are usually obvious — and they make you sound less confident.

## Where to go next (hub spokes)
Use these pages based on what you need:

- **Etiquette for video and in-person**: [College Interview Etiquette (Video & In-Person)](/blog/college-interview-etiquette-video-call)  
- **Follow-up template**: [Alumni Interview Follow-Up Email Template](/blog/alumni-interview-follow-up-email-template)  
- **Recommendations support**: [Teacher Recommendation Request Template](/blog/teacher-recommendation-request-template)  
- **Choosing recommenders strategically**: [How to Choose the Right Recommenders](/blog/how-to-choose-recommenders)

## A simple interview structure you can reuse
When you’re answering a behavioral or “tell me about…” question, use a lightweight structure:

- **Context (1 sentence)**: what was the situation?  
- **Action (2–3 sentences)**: what did you do specifically?  
- **Result (1 sentence)**: what changed (numbers help)?  
- **Reflection (1 sentence)**: what did you learn and how does it show up now?

This keeps you from telling a story that never lands.

## What to do the week before
Here’s a high-ROI prep plan that doesn’t take over your life:

- **Day 1**: write a 90-second “about me” answer + 3 proof points  
- **Day 2**: practice 8–10 common questions out loud (record yourself once)  
- **Day 3**: prepare 3 “Why this school” specifics + 3 questions for the interviewer  
- **Day 4**: run one timed mock interview (even with a parent/friend)  
- **Day 5**: finalize logistics (tech, location, attire) and stop over-prepping

## Common mistakes (and quick fixes)
- **Mistake: answering indirectly.**  
  **Fix**: lead with the answer, then add detail.

- **Mistake: listing accomplishments without meaning.**  
  **Fix**: pick one example and show decision-making and growth.

- **Mistake: “Why this school?” that could fit any school.**  
  **Fix**: tie your interests to a specific class, lab, program, or community.

- **Mistake: forgetting the follow-up.**  
  **Fix**: send a short thank-you within 24 hours with one detail you appreciated.

## Final reminder
An interview is not a trap. It’s an opportunity to make your application feel human. If you prepare with structure and proof points — and speak like yourself — you’ll be ahead of most applicants.
