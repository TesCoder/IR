Selective private supplements reward specificity.

Most “fine” drafts fail because they:

- summarize the school instead of proving fit,
- list programs without explaining “so what,” or
- use generic values language that could apply anywhere.

This guide gives you example patterns and a copy/paste checklist you can use to pressure-test your drafts.

Use this guide if you're drafting supplements for highly selective private universities — especially "Why Us" and community/identity prompts for schools like Duke, Northwestern, or Stanford.

## Packet

### Example pattern: “Why Us” (fit as a plan)

**Thesis + academic specifics + community + contribution**

Mini example (structure, not a full essay):

“I’m drawn to [School] because I want to deepen my work in ___ at the intersection of ___ and ___. I’m especially excited by ___ (class/lab/program) because it would let me ___ (specific next step tied to your past work). Outside the classroom, I’m looking for a community where I can ___; I can see myself contributing through ___ (club/community) by ___ (specific contribution).”

What makes it strong:

- Includes a trajectory (past → next step)
- Uses fewer specifics, explained well
- Ends with contribution (not admiration)

### Example pattern: Community / identity / contribution

Mini example:

“In my ___ community, I’ve learned that contribution often means ___ (specific behavior). When ___ happened, I ___ (action) and ___ (outcome). That’s why I’m excited about [School]’s ___ community — not because it’s ‘inclusive’ in the abstract, but because I plan to show up by ___ (concrete contribution).”

What makes it strong:

- Uses actions and outcomes, not labels
- Shows how you will contribute on campus

### Do / Don’t checklist

**Do**

- Do write a fit thesis in one sentence (what you’ll study + where + how you’ll contribute)
- Do use 2–3 specifics with “so what” explanations
- Do connect details to your track record (proof points)
- Do end with forward motion (what you’ll do)

**Don’t**

- Don’t list 10 programs without explanation
- Don’t use rankings/prestige as a reason
- Don’t write “community” and “diversity” without showing what you did and will do
- Don’t copy/paste a draft and swap the school name

## Which prompt type is this?

Before you draft, identify which category your supplement falls into. Each type looks similar on the surface — the school wants to "know you better" — but each tests something different, and the most common failure is different for each.

| Prompt type | What the school is actually testing | What differentiates a strong response | Most common failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Why Us | Whether your interest in this specific school is genuine and based on fit — not prestige | A clear trajectory: your past work → a named resource or faculty at this school → a concrete contribution you'll make on campus | Listing programs or facts any applicant could Google; ends in admiration rather than forward motion |
| Community / identity / contribution | Whether you bring a distinct perspective or practice to campus culture | A specific action you took in a community you belong to, plus a named campus community or program where you'd replicate that behavior | Using "diversity," "inclusion," or "belonging" in the abstract without showing what you actually do |
| Intellectual passion | Whether your academic interest has depth and direction — enough to sustain four years of inquiry | Framing an unresolved question or gap your coursework, research, or reading raised — then naming where you'd pursue it at this school | Describing the topic broadly ("I've always loved biology") without showing how you think at the edge of what you know |
| Extracurricular deep-dive | Whether your outside-class activity reveals character, skill, or a story the rest of your application doesn't tell | A specific moment of difficulty, mistake, or pivot — not a resume recap | A chronological account of what you did, with no moment of conflict, choice, or growth |

## Aisha's "Why Duke" draft: applying the "Why Us" pattern

Aisha is a senior applying to Duke and Northwestern. Over the past year, she built a small corpus-analysis tool to study dialect variation in Twitter data — she started it after noticing that NLP tools she used in class performed worse on African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Her background spans both linguistics and computer science.

**Applying the "Why Us" pattern to Duke:**

- **Thesis + trajectory:** Her past work (the dialect corpus project) → what she still needs (a rigorous computational linguistics framework + sociolinguistics faculty access) → Duke's specific fit (Linguistics/CS joint concentration + relevant faculty research)
- **Specifics, explained:** The joint concentration is named and tied to an active question she's trying to answer, not a general academic interest
- **Contribution, not admiration:** She identifies a named Duke community (Baldwin Scholars) and a transferable activity she'd continue there

**Example (~150 words):**

> "I've spent the last year building a corpus tool that analyzes dialect variation in social media text — and I keep running into the same problem: the training data I can access is biased toward standard written English in ways I don't yet know how to fix. Duke's Linguistics and Computer Science joint concentration is where I want to work on that question properly. I'm especially drawn to the lab research on parsing non-standard English syntax, which is exactly the gap I've been circling in my own project. Outside that work, I want to keep doing what I already do in my neighborhood: translating — not between languages, but between people who don't realize they're talking about the same thing. I can see myself in Duke's Baldwin Scholars program, which takes that kind of bridge-building seriously at an institutional level. I'd contribute by continuing the linguistics workshop series I started at my school."

**Why this works:**
- Opens with a specific problem, not a school compliment
- Ties the school's resource to an open question she can't answer alone
- Contribution is concrete: a named program plus a transferable activity, not "I want to be part of your community"

## What if you're a STEM student writing a community/identity supplement and feel you have nothing to say?

This is one of the most common places STEM-focused applicants get stuck. The prompt asks for community or identity, and the instinct is to reach for a science club or lab — but that feels too academic for an "identity" prompt, and your non-academic life feels too thin to write about.

Three specific reframe strategies:

**1. Your lab or research environment is a community — describe how you show up in it.**
What do you do when an experiment fails and the team doesn't know why? When a newer student is struggling and the PI is unavailable? Your behavior inside a technical community is a community story. Write the specific moment, not the general claim that you "collaborated well." What did you say, what did you do, what happened because of it?

**2. A gap or frustration you encountered in STEM is a contribution narrative in disguise.**
If you noticed that existing tools or resources in your field assumed a background you didn't have — or that your school's CS curriculum skipped topics that mattered to students with your experience — that frustration is a community essay waiting to be written. "I noticed X was missing for students like me, so I built / organized / started Y" is a stronger community narrative than "I am a member of group Z and I value representation."

**3. Your STEM work intersects with an identity you've been hesitant to write about — the overlap is the essay.**
Aisha's corpus project is simultaneously a CS project and a story about language, belonging, and what gets excluded from systems. If your technical work is motivated by something personal, the supplement is asking you to say that directly — not to hide it behind methodology. The school is not asking you to justify your identity. It is asking you to show how your identity has shaped what you build and where you want to go.
