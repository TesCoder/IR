Selective private supplements reward specificity.

Most “fine” drafts fail because they:

- summarize the school instead of proving fit,
- list programs without explaining “so what,” or
- use generic values language that could apply anywhere.

This guide gives you example patterns and a copy/paste checklist you can use to pressure-test your drafts.

## Packet

### Example pattern: “Why Us” (fit as a plan)

**Thesis + academic specifics + community + contribution**

Mini example (structure, not a full essay):

“I’m drawn to [School] because I want to deepen my work in ___ at the intersection of ___ and ___. I’m especially excited by ___ (class/lab/program) because it would let me ___ (specific next step tied to your past work). Outside the classroom, I’m looking for a community where I can ___; I can see myself contributing through ___ (club/community) by ___ (specific contribution).”

What makes it strong:

- Includes a trajectory (past → next step)
- Uses fewer specifics, explained well
- Ends with contribution (not admiration)

### Example pattern: Community / identity / contribution

Mini example:

“In my ___ community, I’ve learned that contribution often means ___ (specific behavior). When ___ happened, I ___ (action) and ___ (outcome). That’s why I’m excited about [School]’s ___ community — not because it’s ‘inclusive’ in the abstract, but because I plan to show up by ___ (concrete contribution).”

What makes it strong:

- Uses actions and outcomes, not labels
- Shows how you will contribute on campus

### Do / Don’t checklist

**Do**

- Do write a fit thesis in one sentence (what you’ll study + where + how you’ll contribute)
- Do use 2–3 specifics with “so what” explanations
- Do connect details to your track record (proof points)
- Do end with forward motion (what you’ll do)

**Don’t**

- Don’t list 10 programs without explanation
- Don’t use rankings/prestige as a reason
- Don’t write “community” and “diversity” without showing what you did and will do
- Don’t copy/paste a draft and swap the school name
