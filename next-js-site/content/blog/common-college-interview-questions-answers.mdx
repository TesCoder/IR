Most college interviews are not trying to trap you.

Interviewers usually want to reduce uncertainty: can you communicate clearly, reflect honestly, and explain your interests with real proof points?

This guide lists common interview questions and simple frameworks you can use to answer without sounding rehearsed.

Use this guide whether you're preparing for an alumni Zoom call, an on-campus interview, or a school-arranged session.

## The two best answer frameworks

### STAR (Situation → Task → Action → Result)
Best for behavioral questions (“Tell me about a time…”).

### PEEL (Point → Evidence → Explain → Link)
Best for “why” questions (“Why this school?”, “Why this major?”).

## Common interview questions (and how to answer)

### 1) “Tell me about yourself.”
Use **Past → Present → Future** (60–90 seconds):

- Past: what shaped your interests
- Present: what you’re doing now (one or two proof points)
- Future: what you want to explore in college and why

### 2) “Why this school?”
Use PEEL:

- Point: your fit thesis (what you want to study/do)
- Evidence: 2–3 specifics (classes/labs/programs/communities)
- Explain: how each detail fits your trajectory
- Link: contribution/forward motion

### 3) “Why this major?”
Answer with:

- a moment of interest,
- proof you pursued it,
- and what you want to do next.

### 4) “What’s your favorite class (or subject)?”
Name the class, then explain:

- what skill it built,
- and how you used it beyond the assignment.

### 5) “Tell me about a challenge.”
Use STAR and end with reflection:

- what you did differently next time,
- and what changed because of it.

### 6) “Tell me about a failure.”
Strong answers show:

- ownership (no blame),
- iteration (specific change),
- growth (new behavior, not a slogan).

### 7) “Tell me about leadership.”
Don’t lead with a title. Lead with responsibility + outcome:

“I owned ___ and improved ___ by ___.”

### 8) “What do you do for fun?”
Pick something real. AOs want a human.

### 9) “What book/podcast/topic do you like?”
Answer with:

- what you learned,
- and how it affected your thinking or choices.

### 10) “What would you change about your school/community?”
Be constructive:

- name one issue,
- propose a realistic improvement,
- connect to what you’ve done (if applicable).

### 11) “What’s your greatest strength?”
Tie it to a proof point:

“I’m strong at ___, and here’s a time it mattered…”

### 12) “What’s your greatest weakness?”
Pick something real but manageable, and show mitigation:

- what you noticed,
- what you changed,
- what’s better now.

### 13) “What questions do you have for me?”
Prepare 2–3 questions that show research:

- “How do students actually engage with ___?”
- “What kind of student thrives in ___?”
- “What surprised you about the community?”

Avoid questions answered on the homepage.

## How to practice without sounding scripted

Good practice looks like:

- bullet points, not full scripts
- 3–5 proof points you can reuse
- one timed mock interview (record yourself once)

If you memorize paragraphs, you’ll sound less confident.

## Mia’s prep: STAR and PEEL applied to two real questions

Mia is a senior applying to Vanderbilt and Wake Forest. She’s the debate team captain, completed a summer internship at her city council’s communications office, and is targeting a political science or public policy major.

Here’s how she drafted answers to two questions she knew she’d face.

### Question: “Tell me about a challenge you overcame.” (STAR)

**Before:**
> “I had a hard time when our debate team was short-staffed before a big tournament. It was stressful but we got through it and ended up doing well.”

**Why this falls short:** No setting, no specific action Mia took, no measurable result. The interviewer learns nothing about how Mia thinks or operates under pressure.

**After (STAR applied):**
> “Last fall, our debate team lost two members three weeks before regionals — dropping from six to four. As captain, I had to reassign all six roles across four people, including taking on a research-intensive position I hadn’t prepared for. I spent two extra hours each weekday building the brief from scratch and ran three additional practice rounds with the team. We placed second at regionals — our best finish in four years. I learned I can build something quickly under pressure when I stay focused on the specific output, not the overwhelm.”

What changed: **Situation** (team lost members before regionals) → **Task** (reassign roles, cover an unfamiliar position) → **Action** (extra daily hours, new brief, added practice rounds) → **Result** (2nd place, best in four years) + one-sentence reflection.

### Question: “Why Vanderbilt?” (PEEL)

**Before:**
> “I love Vanderbilt’s community and the opportunities it offers. The campus looks amazing and I’ve heard great things about the professors.”

**Why this falls short:** No specific evidence, no connection to Mia’s trajectory. Any student could say this about any school — it signals no real research.

**After (PEEL applied):**
> “I want to study the intersection of urban policy and civic communication — specifically how city governments communicate during crises. Vanderbilt’s Robert T. Stafford Program in Public Policy is one of the few undergraduate tracks that pairs policy coursework with hands-on simulations, and I’d want to connect that to the Law and Human Values seminar in my junior year. My internship at the city council this past summer showed me that decision-makers need better communication frameworks, not just more data — and that’s the gap I want to research. At Vanderbilt, I’d be building toward that through a specific program, not just taking general electives.”

What changed: **Point** (urban policy + civic communication) → **Evidence** (Stafford Program, Law and Human Values seminar) → **Explain** (how each detail connects to what she saw at the city council) → **Link** (forward motion: what she wants to build there, not just what she likes about the campus).

## What if you blank on a question mid-interview?

It happens. Even well-prepared students hit a moment of silence on a question they didn’t expect. Here are three recovery strategies:

**1. Buy yourself 5–10 seconds with a bridge phrase.**
Say: “That’s a question I want to answer thoughtfully — let me take a second.” Then pause. Interviewers expect this. A deliberate pause reads as composed, not unprepared. The students who stumble most are the ones who rush past the silence and say something vague.

**2. Anchor to a proof point you’ve already mentioned.**
If your mind goes blank on specifics, return to something you do know: “I want to give you a concrete example, so let me pull from something I mentioned earlier…” Then reframe a story you’ve already told. Different framing still works — you’re not repeating yourself, you’re applying the same proof point to a new angle.

**3. Acknowledge the gap honestly and pivot.**
If you genuinely can’t answer a specific question (for example, you haven’t read a particular professor’s work), say: “I haven’t connected directly with that research yet, but here’s what I do know about the direction I want to go…” Admissions interviewers value honesty over performance. A confident “I don’t know yet, but here’s what I do know” lands better than a vague, improvised non-answer.
