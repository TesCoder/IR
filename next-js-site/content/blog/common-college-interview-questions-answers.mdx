Most college interviews are not trying to trap you.

Interviewers usually want to reduce uncertainty: can you communicate clearly, reflect honestly, and explain your interests with real proof points?

This guide lists common interview questions and simple frameworks you can use to answer without sounding rehearsed.

## The two best answer frameworks

### STAR (Situation → Task → Action → Result)
Best for behavioral questions (“Tell me about a time…”).

### PEEL (Point → Evidence → Explain → Link)
Best for “why” questions (“Why this school?”, “Why this major?”).

## Common interview questions (and how to answer)

### 1) “Tell me about yourself.”
Use **Past → Present → Future** (60–90 seconds):

- Past: what shaped your interests
- Present: what you’re doing now (one or two proof points)
- Future: what you want to explore in college and why

### 2) “Why this school?”
Use PEEL:

- Point: your fit thesis (what you want to study/do)
- Evidence: 2–3 specifics (classes/labs/programs/communities)
- Explain: how each detail fits your trajectory
- Link: contribution/forward motion

### 3) “Why this major?”
Answer with:

- a moment of interest,
- proof you pursued it,
- and what you want to do next.

### 4) “What’s your favorite class (or subject)?”
Name the class, then explain:

- what skill it built,
- and how you used it beyond the assignment.

### 5) “Tell me about a challenge.”
Use STAR and end with reflection:

- what you did differently next time,
- and what changed because of it.

### 6) “Tell me about a failure.”
Strong answers show:

- ownership (no blame),
- iteration (specific change),
- growth (new behavior, not a slogan).

### 7) “Tell me about leadership.”
Don’t lead with a title. Lead with responsibility + outcome:

“I owned ___ and improved ___ by ___.”

### 8) “What do you do for fun?”
Pick something real. AOs want a human.

### 9) “What book/podcast/topic do you like?”
Answer with:

- what you learned,
- and how it affected your thinking or choices.

### 10) “What would you change about your school/community?”
Be constructive:

- name one issue,
- propose a realistic improvement,
- connect to what you’ve done (if applicable).

### 11) “What’s your greatest strength?”
Tie it to a proof point:

“I’m strong at ___, and here’s a time it mattered…”

### 12) “What’s your greatest weakness?”
Pick something real but manageable, and show mitigation:

- what you noticed,
- what you changed,
- what’s better now.

### 13) “What questions do you have for me?”
Prepare 2–3 questions that show research:

- “How do students actually engage with ___?”
- “What kind of student thrives in ___?”
- “What surprised you about the community?”

Avoid questions answered on the homepage.

## How to practice without sounding scripted

Good practice looks like:

- bullet points, not full scripts
- 3–5 proof points you can reuse
- one timed mock interview (record yourself once)

If you memorize paragraphs, you’ll sound less confident.
