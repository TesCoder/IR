FAFSA mistakes are rarely “hard.” They’re usually *avoidable*: missing documents, mis-matched names, late submissions, or small errors that trigger verification and delay aid.

This guide gives you a clean FAFSA workflow and a checklist you can use to file on time without chaos.

Note: This is general education, not legal or financial advice. Policies and requirements can change; always confirm with the FAFSA site and each college’s financial aid office.

## The goal: file early and file clean

Two principles reduce almost every problem:

- **Start earlier than you think** (because corrections and verification happen)
- **Organize documents once** (so you don’t scramble in the middle)

FAFSA is often the first step — many schools also require additional forms or portals.

## FAFSA timeline (plan backwards)

A practical approach:

- **6–10 weeks before deadlines**: gather documents, create accounts, confirm which parent/guardian files
- **As soon as FAFSA opens**: submit your first clean version
- **Following weeks**: respond quickly to verification or missing items

If you wait until the deadline week, you remove your buffer for surprises.

## Step-by-step: the FAFSA workflow

### Step 1: Confirm who files (and what counts as a parent)
FAFSA rules about parent information can surprise families (divorce, remarriage, guardianship). Confirm early so you don’t redo the form later.

### Step 2: Create accounts and match identities
Use consistent identifying information:

- Legal names (including suffixes)
- Dates of birth
- Social Security numbers (where applicable)

Small mismatches are a common cause of delays.

### Step 3: Gather tax and income documents
Even when tax tools exist, you still want the documents available for checking.

### Step 4: Enter schools carefully
Make sure the school list and deadlines align with your application strategy (ED/EA/RD). Some institutions have earlier priority aid deadlines than application deadlines.

### Step 5: Submit, then track portals
Submitting FAFSA is not the finish line. Many schools require:

- Institutional portals
- Additional verification
- Separate scholarships/honors forms

## Common FAFSA mistakes (and fixes)

- **Mistake: waiting for “perfect” information.**  
  **Fix**: file early; correct later if needed.

- **Mistake: missing deadlines because you assumed “application deadline = aid deadline.”**  
  **Fix**: track each school’s priority aid deadline separately.

- **Mistake: errors in parent data (especially in complex family situations).**  
  **Fix**: confirm rules early; ask the financial aid office if needed.

- **Mistake: disorganized documents.**  
  **Fix**: one shared folder with labeled files (PDFs/scans).
