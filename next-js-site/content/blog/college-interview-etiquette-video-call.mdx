Interview etiquette isn’t about being “polished.” It’s about removing avoidable distractions.

Most interviewers are evaluating your clarity and fit — but tech problems, rushed logistics, or awkward openings can pull attention away from your story.

This guide gives you a simple checklist for video and in-person interviews, plus sample openings and closings you can adapt.

## The day-before checklist (high ROI)

- Confirm date/time and time zone
- Confirm the interview format (Zoom/phone/in-person) and location link/address
- Choose a quiet space (and tell your household)
- Prepare notes: 3 proof points + 2 questions for the interviewer
- Pick your outfit (simple, professional, comfortable)
- Get sleep — over-prepping late usually makes you worse

## Video interview etiquette (Zoom/Google Meet)

### Tech setup
- Test camera and microphone
- Use stable internet (ethernet if possible)
- Close extra tabs and notifications
- Place camera at eye level

### Environment
- Neutral background and good lighting (face lit from the front)
- Avoid backlighting (window behind you)
- Have water nearby

### On-screen behavior
- Look at the camera while answering key points
- Don’t read from a script (it’s obvious)
- Pause briefly before answering tough questions — it reads as thoughtful

## In-person interview etiquette

- Arrive 10–15 minutes early
- Bring a notebook and pen (optional, but helpful)
- Offer a firm handshake if appropriate; follow interviewer cues
- Keep phone on silent and out of sight
- Sit with open posture and calm pacing

## Sample opening (natural, not scripted)

“Hi [Name], thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I’m excited to learn more about [School] — and I’m looking forward to sharing a bit about what I’m interested in and what I’ve been working on.”

Then answer “Tell me about yourself” with a 60–90 second overview.

## Sample closing

“Thank you — this was really helpful. I especially appreciated hearing about [specific detail]. Before we wrap up, is there anything you’d recommend I explore to learn more about [program/community]?”

Then confirm the follow-up expectations.

## The 24-hour follow-up rule

Send a brief thank-you email within 24 hours:

- 2–4 sentences
- one detail you appreciated
- one sentence of continued interest
