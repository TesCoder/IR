Interview etiquette isn’t about being “polished.” It’s about removing avoidable distractions.

Most interviewers are evaluating your clarity and fit — but tech problems, rushed logistics, or awkward openings can pull attention away from your story.

This guide gives you a simple checklist for video and in-person interviews, plus sample openings and closings you can adapt.

Use this checklist whether you're preparing for an alumni Zoom call, an on-campus visit, or a phone interview.

## Which format applies to you?

| Format | What to prioritize | What's different |
|---|---|---|
| Zoom alumni interview | Tech setup, camera eye contact, clean background | Alumni are often volunteers; tone is conversational; questions are less scripted than AO interviews |
| On-campus with admissions officer | Arrival timing, physical composure, follow the AO's lead | Formal setting; may run 20–30 min; first impression is immediate and physical |
| Phone call | Voice pacing, deliberate pauses, printed notes nearby | No visual cues for either party; pausing reads more prominently; harder to gauge the interviewer's reaction |

Use the sections below for your format. Phone interviews: skip the video setup steps and focus on the day-before checklist and in-person behavior guidance (pacing and pauses apply equally).

## The day-before checklist (high ROI)

- Confirm date/time and time zone
- Confirm the interview format (Zoom/phone/in-person) and location link/address
- Choose a quiet space (and tell your household)
- Prepare notes: 3 proof points + 2 questions for the interviewer
- Pick your outfit (simple, professional, comfortable)
- Get sleep — over-prepping late usually makes you worse

## Video interview etiquette (Zoom/Google Meet)

### Tech setup
- Test camera and microphone
- Use stable internet (ethernet if possible)
- Close extra tabs and notifications
- Place camera at eye level

### Environment
- Neutral background and good lighting (face lit from the front)
- Avoid backlighting (window behind you)
- Have water nearby

### On-screen behavior
- Look at the camera while answering key points
- Don’t read from a script (it’s obvious)
- Pause briefly before answering tough questions — it reads as thoughtful

## In-person interview etiquette

- Arrive 10–15 minutes early
- Bring a notebook and pen (optional, but helpful)
- Offer a firm handshake if appropriate; follow interviewer cues
- Keep phone on silent and out of sight
- Sit with open posture and calm pacing

## Devon's prep week: day-by-day Zoom interview setup and rehearsal

Devon is a senior applying to Cornell's College of Engineering. Her alumni Zoom interview was scheduled for Thursday at 6 PM. Here's how she structured the five days before:

**Day 1 (Sunday):** Researched Cornell Engineering and wrote down 3 proof points — her robotics club co-captain role, a summer coding program, and a specific professor's lab she'd found through the department site. Drafted 2 questions for the interviewer.

**Day 2 (Monday):** Full tech run. Tested Zoom audio and video, propped her laptop on books to raise the camera to eye level, turned on a desk lamp facing her (front-lit), confirmed ethernet connection, and chose a plain wall as background. Identified a mic buzz and switched to earbuds.

**Day 3 (Tuesday):** Rehearsed "Tell me about yourself" out loud — timed it at 85 seconds. Practiced two likely questions: "Why Cornell?" and "Tell me about a challenge you've overcome." Noticed she was saying "um" repeatedly; slowed her pace and added deliberate pauses instead.

**Day 4 (Wednesday):** Mock interview with a classmate over Zoom. Asked for feedback on camera eye contact (she kept looking at her own thumbnail) and answer length. Trimmed "Why Cornell?" from 3 minutes to 90 seconds by cutting backstory and leading with the specific professor connection.

**Day 5 (Thursday — day of):** Logged into Zoom 20 minutes early. Re-checked audio and lighting. Placed her 3 proof points on a sticky note just below the camera lens. Silenced her phone, closed all extra tabs, told her family the 45-minute window was blocked.

The interview lasted 28 minutes. Devon said the biggest advantage was that nothing felt rushed — she had already solved the tech problems days earlier, so her full attention stayed on the conversation.

## Sample opening (natural, not scripted)

“Hi [Name], thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I’m excited to learn more about [School] — and I’m looking forward to sharing a bit about what I’m interested in and what I’ve been working on.”

Then answer “Tell me about yourself” with a 60–90 second overview.

## Sample closing

“Thank you — this was really helpful. I especially appreciated hearing about [specific detail]. Before we wrap up, is there anything you’d recommend I explore to learn more about [program/community]?”

Then confirm the follow-up expectations.

## The 24-hour follow-up rule

Send a brief thank-you email within 24 hours:

- 2–4 sentences
- one detail you appreciated
- one sentence of continued interest

## What if your tech fails mid-interview?

Tech problems happen. Having your recovery moves ready means you won't freeze when they do.

**Move 1 — Audio drops or cuts out:**  
Immediately type in the Zoom or Google Meet chat: *"Audio issue — give me 10 seconds."* Toggle your mic off and back on. If that doesn't fix it, leave the meeting and rejoin. This takes under 30 seconds and interviewers expect it.

**Move 2 — Your video freezes:**  
Say clearly: *"I think I may have frozen — can you still hear me?"* If they confirm audio is fine, keep going on audio-only. A frozen video is a distraction; an unfazed, calm voice is not. Don't apologize repeatedly — acknowledge it once and move on.

**Move 3 — Complete connection drop:**  
Before the interview starts, have the interviewer's email open on your phone. If you get fully dropped, send within 2 minutes: *"My connection dropped — I'm so sorry. I'm trying to reconnect now. If that doesn't work, can we continue by phone? My number is [X]."* Keep it brief and composed.

Why this matters: interviewers aren't evaluating your WiFi. They're watching how you handle a small, unexpected problem. Staying calm, communicating clearly, and recovering quickly is itself a signal of composure under pressure — exactly what they're there to assess.
