One of the biggest financial aid mistakes families make is assuming all aid works the same way.

It doesn’t.

**Need-based aid** and **merit aid** are driven by different incentives, different timelines, and different “levers” you can control. When you treat them as the same thing, you can design a school list that looks great on paper — and becomes unaffordable in April.

This guide explains the strategic difference and how to plan accordingly.

Note: This is general education, not legal or financial advice. Always confirm policies with each college.

## Need-based aid: what drives it

Need-based aid is (mostly) determined by:

- Your family’s financial profile (as assessed via FAFSA and/or CSS Profile)
- The school’s aid policy and budget
- How the school calculates “need” and what it expects you to pay

Your job is to:

- File accurately and early
- Meet all deadlines
- Provide documentation quickly when requested

## Merit aid: what drives it

Merit aid is (mostly) driven by:

- A school’s enrollment goals (yield, shaping the class)
- Your academic profile relative to their admitted pool
- Institutional priorities (major mix, geographic diversity, special talent, etc.)

Merit aid is not “fair.” It’s strategic.

Your job is to:

- Build a school list where you are strong relative to the school
- Present a compelling academic profile and narrative
- Hit priority deadlines (some merit is deadline-sensitive)

## Why this matters for your school list

A smart affordability plan usually includes:

- Some schools where you are likely to receive meaningful merit
- Some schools where need-based aid is strong (policy-dependent)
- A clear understanding of worst-case net price outcomes

You don’t want to discover in April that every “favorite” option is outside budget.

## Practical steps to build an aid strategy

### Step 1: Run net price calculators early
NPCs aren’t perfect, but they prevent fantasy planning.

### Step 2: Separate “sticker price” from “expected cost”
Two schools with the same sticker price can have very different net outcomes.

### Step 3: Track merit and scholarship deadlines like application deadlines
Some scholarship consideration deadlines are earlier than RD deadlines.

### Step 4: Build leverage (ethically)
Leverage often comes from:

- Comparable offers
- Clear documentation of changed circumstances
- Meeting all deadlines cleanly

## Common mistakes

- **Mistake: assuming prestige schools will be “cheaper.”**  
  **Fix**: run NPCs for each school; policies vary.

- **Mistake: ignoring merit strategy until senior spring.**  
  **Fix**: design the school list with merit in mind from the start.

- **Mistake: comparing offers without a template.**  
  **Fix**: build a comparison system now.
