Need-based aid and merit aid run on different rules, timelines, and levers. Picking the right strategy keeps your school list affordable.

Note: General education, not legal or financial advice. Confirm policies with each college.

## Merit vs need — quick definitions and tradeoffs

- **Need-based aid:** driven by FAFSA/CSS data, school policy, and budget; strongest at schools that meet high percentages of need.
- **Merit aid:** enrollment strategy to attract specific profiles (academics, major, geography, talent); not tied to need.
- Tradeoff: high-need families often lean need-based; strong academic profiles may secure merit at target/safety schools.

## Profiles that fit each strategy

- Merit-leaning: top-of-pool academics/test scores, special talent, honors/departmental scholarships available, willing to apply early.
- Need-leaning: demonstrable financial need, schools with strong need-based policies, ability to document special circumstances.
- Hybrid: mix the list—at least 2–3 likely merit schools + 2–3 strong-need schools; run net price calculators for both paths.

## How to maximize merit (timing, essays, outreach)

- Hit scholarship/priority deadlines (often earlier than RD).
- Showcase department-fit: honors programs, major-specific scholarships, faculty outreach where appropriate.
- Tighten academics: retake tests if score gains are likely; present clear academic spike and leadership impact.
- Keep “yield signals” clean: demonstrated interest where it matters (visits, on-time apps, clean docs).

## When to appeal a need-based award

- New information: income loss, medical expenses, business downturn, sibling now in college.
- Comparable offers from peer schools with similar selectivity.
- Documentation ready: clear bullet list of attachments, dates, and the net cost gap you need to close.
- Ask if re-review is possible after updates; stay polite and concise.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Assuming prestige = cheaper; always run NPCs.
- Ignoring renewal rules for merit (GPA/credit/major requirements).
- Treating loans/work-study as discounts; track them separately in net cost.
