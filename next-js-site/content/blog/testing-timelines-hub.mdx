For most families, testing gets stressful for one reason: **the calendar is unclear.**

You hear “start early,” “don’t peak too soon,” “retake if you can,” “test optional changes everything,” and none of it tells you what to do next week. This hub is a practical map for aligning **diagnostics, first test dates, retakes, score sends, and admissions deadlines** so you can make decisions with fewer surprises.

## The goal: optionality, not obsession
Your goal is to create *options*:

- An SAT/ACT plan that fits your course load and activities
- Enough time for one meaningful retake (if needed)
- A clear decision point on whether to submit scores

When you plan for optionality, you avoid panic-studying the month before deadlines.

## A simple way to think about the testing year
Most strong testing plans have three phases:

### 1) Diagnose (2–3 weeks)
Take a full-length diagnostic under realistic conditions. Your score is not your identity; it’s a starting point that tells you **which test fits you** and how big the gap is.

### 2) Build (8–12 weeks)
This is the real work: skill gaps, pacing, accuracy, and timing. Consistency matters more than long weekend marathons.

### 3) Execute (test + retake window)
Choose a first test date with time for a retake if needed — and a clear “stop” rule so testing doesn’t eat your entire junior year.

## Where to go next (hub spokes)
Use the pages below based on your decision:

- **Choosing SAT vs ACT (and timing)**: [When to Take the SAT vs ACT](/blog/when-to-take-sat-vs-act)  
- **Understanding PSAT vs SAT stakes**: [PSAT vs SAT: What Actually Matters](/blog/psat-vs-sat-what-matters)  
- **Aligning tests with admissions rounds**: [ED vs EA vs RD Admissions Calendar](/blog/ed-vs-ea-vs-rd-admissions-calendar)  
- **Score reporting strategy**: [Score Choice & Superscoring Guide](/blog/score-choice-superscoring-guide)  
- **Getting accommodations approved**: [Testing Accommodations for SAT/ACT](/blog/testing-accommodations-sat-act)

## A practical timeline (what “on track” looks like)
This is a common, low-stress path for students targeting selective schools:

- **10th grade spring / summer**: diagnostic + decide SAT vs ACT  
- **11th grade fall**: build skills + take first official test  
- **11th grade winter/spring**: retake window if needed (and stop if you hit your target)  
- **12th grade fall**: only test again if there’s a clear ROI and it doesn’t hurt essays/app quality  

Not every student needs the same plan. The right plan matches your academic load, attention bandwidth, and deadlines.

## Common mistakes (and what to do instead)
- **Mistake: starting with a prep class before diagnosing.**  
  **Do instead**: diagnose first so your effort targets real weaknesses.

- **Mistake: choosing SAT vs ACT based on “what’s easier.”**  
  **Do instead**: choose based on fit: pacing, error patterns, and which test rewards your strengths.

- **Mistake: endless retakes without a strategy.**  
  **Do instead**: set a retake rule (e.g., retake only if practice tests show a meaningful gain).

- **Mistake: ignoring score reporting rules.**  
  **Do instead**: learn Score Choice, superscoring, and what schools actually require.

## The fast self-check
If you can answer these, you’re in good shape:

1. Which test are you taking, and why?  
2. What’s your first test date, and is there a retake window?  
3. What’s your target score range (not a single number)?  
4. What’s your stop rule?  
5. How does this align with ED/EA/RD deadlines?

If any answer is fuzzy, start with the specific spoke that matches the gap — and you’ll reduce most of the stress immediately.
