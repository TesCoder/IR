Financial aid can feel opaque because families are trying to solve multiple problems at once:

- **Deadlines** (FAFSA, CSS Profile, school-specific forms)
- **Documentation** (what you need, what you don’t, how to avoid corrections)
- **Strategy** (merit vs need-based aid, scholarship planning, appeals)
- **Decision-making** (how to compare offers beyond the sticker price)

This hub organizes the process into clear steps so you can reduce mistakes, avoid delays, and make better decisions when offers arrive.

## The big idea: plan the year you file, not the week you file
Most “aid problems” are actually *timeline problems*. When you file late or missing documents, you lose leverage and create stress right when essays and deadlines are also peaking.

A strong aid plan usually has three phases:

1. **Preparation** (documents, accounts, deadlines)  
2. **Submission** (FAFSA/CSS done early and correctly)  
3. **Decision + leverage** (compare offers, negotiate/appeal when appropriate, scholarships as a parallel track)

## Where to go next (hub spokes)
Pick the page that matches what you need right now:

- **FAFSA workflow**: [FAFSA Completion Guide (No Delays)](/blog/fafsa-completion-guide)  
- **CSS Profile docs**: [CSS Profile Documents Checklist](/blog/css-profile-documents-checklist)  
- **Merit vs need strategy**: [Merit Aid vs Need-Based Strategy](/blog/merit-aid-vs-need-based-strategy)  
- **Compare award letters**: [Compare Financial Aid Awards (Template)](/blog/compare-financial-aid-awards)  
- **Appeals and negotiations**: [How to Appeal a Financial Aid Offer](/blog/how-to-appeal-financial-aid-offer)  
- **Scholarship planning**: [Scholarship Search Plan (Tracker)](/blog/scholarship-search-plan)

## What “good” looks like (a family checklist)
Here’s a simple way to reduce risk:

- **Know your schools’ requirements**: some use FAFSA only; some require CSS; many have their own portals.
- **Create a documents folder**: tax returns, W-2s, records of untaxed income, business/farm details if relevant.
- **File early**: early filing reduces corrections, protects processing time, and keeps options open.
- **Track scholarships separately**: treat scholarships like a sprint with weekly quotas and deadlines.
- **Build a comparison system**: don’t wait until offers arrive to “figure it out.”

## Merit vs need-based: the strategic difference
Need-based aid is (mostly) about your financial profile and institutional policy. Merit aid is (mostly) about *how a school can use you to shape the class* — academics, test scores, leadership, talent, and yield priorities.

That’s why the strategy differs:

- For need-based: accuracy, documentation, and deadlines matter most.  
- For merit: positioning (academics, score strategy, school list design) matters a lot.

## Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)
- **Mistake: assuming “net price” will be similar across schools.**  
  **Fix**: run each school’s net price calculator early and treat it as a planning input, not a promise.

- **Mistake: waiting to compare offers until you have an acceptance in hand.**  
  **Fix**: build a template now so you can evaluate quickly when decisions land.

- **Mistake: appealing without evidence.**  
  **Fix**: appeals work when you present new information, comparable offers, or a specific change in circumstances.

- **Mistake: scholarship chaos.**  
  **Fix**: do fewer scholarships, better — with a tracker and a weekly cadence.

## What this hub is (and isn’t)
This is not legal or financial advice, and every school’s policy is different. But the *process* is consistent: plan early, document well, and make decisions with a structured comparison so you don’t miss leverage when it matters.
