Award letters use different formats, mix loans with grants, and hide renewal rules—making “net price” hard to see. This guide shows how to normalize offers, calculate net cost, apply decision rules, and use a comparison template.

Use this guide if you have two or more US college award letters and want to identify which offer gives you the best net financial outcome — whether you’re a domestic or international student.

Note: General education, not financial advice. Confirm details with each aid office.
## What to normalize (grants vs loans vs work-study)

- **Gift aid (grants/scholarships):** keep separate and check renewal terms.
- **Loans:** track interest rates and repayment start; don’t treat as free money.
- **Work-study:** potential earnings, not guaranteed—exclude from net cost.
- **Cost of attendance (COA):** use the school’s COA (tuition, housing, meals, fees, books, travel).

## The net cost formula + quick example

- Net cost = COA – Gift aid (before loans/work-study).
- Example: COA \$72,000 – Gift aid \$32,000 = Net cost \$40,000.  
  If \$5,500 is in unsubsidized loans, note that as debt, not discount.
- Project 4-year cost: watch for tuition hikes and housing changes.

## Decision rules for your shortlist

- Keep annual student loans near the federal limits; avoid large PLUS/private debt without a plan.
- Check renewal: GPA, credit load, major restrictions, and whether awards drop after year one.
- Consider long-term cost (travel, fees, co-op/internship housing) and program fit—not just the sticker.
- If a peer school offer is stronger, ask if your top-choice can reconsider based on net cost.

## The Nguyen family: comparing packages from three different school types

The Nguyen family is comparing award letters for their daughter Lin — a domestic student admitted to three schools with different financial aid models. Household income is ~\$85,000 with one sibling in college.

| | State U (public, in-state) | Westbrook University (mid-size private) | Harmon College (small private, need-meeting) |
|---|---|---|---|
| COA | \$32,000 | \$68,000 | \$74,000 |
| Merit scholarships | \$6,000 | \$18,000 | \$12,000 |
| Need-based grants | — | \$10,000 institutional | \$30,000 |
| **Total gift aid** | **\$6,000** | **\$28,000** | **\$42,000** |
| Federal loans offered | \$5,500 | \$5,500 | \$5,500 |
| Work-study | \$2,500 | \$2,500 | \$2,500 |
| **Net cost (gift aid only)** | **\$26,000** | **\$40,000** | **\$32,000** |

**Applying the decision rules to each offer:**

- **State U (\$26,000 net):** Lowest sticker net cost, but the \$6,000 merit scholarship requires a 3.2 GPA and 15 credits per semester. Off-campus housing after year 1 may add \$2,000–\$3,000 per year. The 4-year trajectory needs confirming before this looks as strong as it does on paper.
- **Westbrook (\$40,000 net):** The award bundles merit and institutional grants, but the \$18,000 merit scholarship drops to \$14,000 if Lin changes her major. The \$8,000 gap vs. Harmon is a candidate for a reconsideration request backed by Harmon's award letter.
- **Harmon (\$32,000 net):** Strongest result despite the highest COA — the need-based grant brings the actual cost below Westbrook. Renewal condition is satisfactory academic progress (2.0 GPA), far less restrictive than the merit thresholds at the other two schools. Need-based aid is stable as long as family income stays consistent.

**Lin's next step:** Request a written multi-year award projection from Westbrook before committing. If the merit scholarship is confirmed stable across all four years, the \$8,000 annual gap vs. Harmon may be worth the program-fit tradeoff. If the projection shows a drop in year 2, Harmon wins on net value.

## What if your aid package changes in year 2 or 3?

Award letters cover one year only. Two common patterns shift your actual 4-year cost — and both are worth modeling before you commit.

**Renewal conditions that reduce aid**

- Merit scholarships typically require a minimum GPA (3.0–3.5) and a full credit load (12–15 credits per semester). A difficult first year, a major change, or a medical leave can eliminate \$5,000–\$20,000 per year going forward.
- Institutional grants sometimes step down after year 1 at private schools — this is legal and not uncommon. Before accepting any offer, ask the aid office directly: *"Is this award the same amount in years 2, 3, and 4?"*

**Your appeal rights if aid changes after enrollment**

- If family income drops after you enroll (job loss, medical expense, divorce), you can file a Special Circumstances Appeal with the financial aid office at any time — not only during the initial admissions cycle.
- If a sibling's enrollment status changes (graduates, withdraws, or adds), re-file the FAFSA immediately; household size directly affects your Expected Family Contribution.
- If your school reduces a merit award in year 2, you retain the right to request a reconsideration meeting. A competing offer you received during admissions — even from a school you declined — remains relevant evidence for that conversation.

**How to price a 4-year commitment, not a 1-year letter**

- Ask for a written 4-year aid projection before you send a deposit. Need-meeting schools often provide one; merit-heavy schools rarely volunteer it. Push for it.
- Model two scenarios: (1) all aid renews as stated; (2) the merit scholarship is lost after year 1. If scenario 2 makes the school unaffordable, that is the real constraint — surface it before you enroll, not mid-way through.
- A \$5,000 annual gap compounding over 4 years is a \$20,000 commitment difference. Net year-1 cost is never the same as 4-year total cost.
