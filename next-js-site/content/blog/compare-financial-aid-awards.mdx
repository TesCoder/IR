Award letters are rarely written to help families compare options easily.

Schools use different formats, different language, and different assumptions — and many families accidentally treat loans and work-study like “free money,” or miss renewal requirements that change the real four-year cost.

This guide shows how to compare offers cleanly and provides a copy/paste template you can fill in.

Note: This is general education, not financial advice. Confirm details with each financial aid office.

## What you’re actually comparing

When you compare awards, separate:

- **Gift aid**: grants and scholarships (usually don’t need repayment)
- **Loans**: borrowed money (repayment matters)
- **Work-study**: an earnings opportunity (not guaranteed cash in your pocket)
- **Cost of attendance (COA)**: tuition + housing + meals + fees + estimates

The key number to compute is your **net cost** (and ideally, a realistic four-year projection).

## The three “gotchas” that change the real cost

### 1) Loans included as “aid”
Loans reduce the bill *now* but increase costs later. Track them separately.

### 2) Scholarships that aren’t guaranteed
Some awards require:

- A GPA threshold
- Full-time enrollment
- Certain majors or course loads

Ask: “What percentage of students keep this scholarship all four years?”

### 3) Hidden cost differences
Housing, meal plans, travel, and fees can vary widely. Two offers with the same tuition can produce very different net outcomes.
