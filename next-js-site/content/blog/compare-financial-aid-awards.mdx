Award letters use different formats, mix loans with grants, and hide renewal rules—making “net price” hard to see. This guide shows how to normalize offers, calculate net cost, apply decision rules, and use a comparison template.

Note: General education, not financial advice. Confirm details with each aid office.

## What to normalize (grants vs loans vs work-study)

- **Gift aid (grants/scholarships):** keep separate and check renewal terms.
- **Loans:** track interest rates and repayment start; don’t treat as free money.
- **Work-study:** potential earnings, not guaranteed—exclude from net cost.
- **Cost of attendance (COA):** use the school’s COA (tuition, housing, meals, fees, books, travel).

## The net cost formula + quick example

- Net cost = COA – Gift aid (before loans/work-study).
- Example: COA \$72,000 – Gift aid \$32,000 = Net cost \$40,000.  
  If \$5,500 is in unsubsidized loans, note that as debt, not discount.
- Project 4-year cost: watch for tuition hikes and housing changes.

## Decision rules for your shortlist

- Keep annual student loans near the federal limits; avoid large PLUS/private debt without a plan.
- Check renewal: GPA, credit load, major restrictions, and whether awards drop after year one.
- Consider long-term cost (travel, fees, co-op/internship housing) and program fit—not just the sticker.
- If a peer school offer is stronger, ask if your top-choice can reconsider based on net cost.
