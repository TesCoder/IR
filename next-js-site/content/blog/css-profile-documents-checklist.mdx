The CSS Profile is often more detailed than the FAFSA, and missing documents can delay aid decisions. Use this checklist to gather and upload what schools typically request — so you avoid common correction requests and stay on schedule.

Note: Educational information only — not legal or financial advice. Requirements vary by institution.

By the end of this checklist, you’ll have:

- A clean list of the most common documents schools request (plus a few “if applicable” edge cases)
- A simple workflow for deadlines, file naming, and uploads (IDOC vs school portals)
- A short list of mistakes that trigger follow-ups — and how to avoid them

Upload requirements vary: some schools use College Board IDOC, others use their own portal. Use your spreadsheet to track *where* each school wants documents and its deadline.

## Quick workflow (IDOC vs school portals)

1. Build a per-school tracker (deadline + upload destination).
2. Gather the documents and export/download full PDFs (all pages).
3. Name files consistently and upload to the correct destination (IDOC vs portal).
4. Re-check status within 24–48 hours and save confirmation PDFs/screenshots.

## CSS Profile checklist (what to upload)

### Common (most families)

- [ ] Recent 2–3 pay stubs, or an employer letter explaining your pay schedule.
- [ ] Bank statements (most recent 2 months; all pages) — download PDFs with an official bank header when possible.
- [ ] A copy of your filed federal tax return (Form 1040) — include schedules when applicable (or an IRS transcript if requested).
- [ ] W-2s / 1099s and records of untaxed income.
- [ ] IDOC / school portal upload instructions and any school-specific forms (if requested).
- [ ] A spreadsheet of each CSS school with its **priority aid deadline** and portal links.
- [ ] PDFs/scans stored in one labeled folder for fast upload/verification.

### If applicable (depends on your situation or school)

- [ ] Non-filer statement / IRS Verification of Nonfiling Letter.
- [ ] Records of child support received/paid.
- [ ] Business/farm documents (P&L, balance sheet, depreciation schedules).
- [ ] Mortgage statements / home value information (if required by the school).
- [ ] Non-custodial parent information (if required; include consent/waiver forms where applicable).
- [ ] Translations + currency conversion notes for international documents.

## Common mistakes & how to avoid them

- Names/SSNs don’t match across parent/student records → use the exact legal names/SSNs everywhere.
- Guessing, rounding, or estimating numbers → pull figures directly from pay stubs, bank statements, and tax forms.
- Uploading to the wrong place (IDOC vs school portal) → use your per-school tracker and confirm destination before uploading.
- Uploading partial documents (screenshots, missing pages) → upload full PDFs (all pages) when possible.
- One-time income changes or business swings with no context → add a short note (dates + explanation) or accountant letter if available.
- Missing “document received” follow-ups after submission → re-check IDOC/portal within 24–48 hours and respond quickly to “missing” requests.

## Submission tips

- Start two weeks before the earliest deadline; ask non-custodial parents for documents early.
- Label files clearly: `StudentName_School_DocumentType_YYYYMMDD.pdf`.
- Keep a cover note ready for unusual situations (job loss, medical costs, business downturn).
- After uploading, re-check IDOC/portal status within 24–48 hours and save confirmation screenshots/PDFs when available.
