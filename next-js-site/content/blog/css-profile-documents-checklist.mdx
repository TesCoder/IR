The CSS Profile is more detailed than FAFSA, and missing documents can slow awards. Use this checklist to upload exactly what schools expect and avoid avoidable corrections.

Note: General education, not legal or financial advice. Requirements vary by institution.

## CSS Profile checklist (what to upload)

- [ ] Recent 2–3 pay stubs or employer letter explaining pay schedule.
- [ ] Bank statements (most recent 2 months) — PDF, official bank header preferred.
- [ ] Copies of signed tax returns (Form 1040) — include schedules when applicable.
- [ ] W-2s / 1099s and records of untaxed income.
- [ ] Records of child support received/paid (if applicable).
- [ ] Business/farm documents (P&L, balance sheet, depreciation schedules if applicable).
- [ ] Mortgage statements / home value information (if required by the school).
- [ ] Non-custodial parent information (if required; include consent forms where applicable).
- [ ] A spreadsheet of each CSS school with its **priority aid deadline** and portal links.
- [ ] PDFs/scans stored in one labeled folder for fast upload/verification.

## Common mistakes & how to avoid them

- Inconsistent names or SSNs between parent/student records—match exactly.
- Guessing numbers instead of using documents; avoid rounding away cents on tax forms.
- Missing context for one-time income or business changes—add a short note or accountant letter.
- Skipping portal checks after submission; upload any “missing” items promptly.

## Submission tips

- Start two weeks before the earliest deadline; ask non-custodial parents for documents early.
- Label files clearly: `StudentName_School_DocumentType_YYYYMMDD.pdf`.
- Keep a cover note ready for unusual situations (job loss, medical costs, business downturn).
