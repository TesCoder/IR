Recommendation letters get stronger when you do two things:

- Ask early (with buffer)
- Make it easy for the teacher to write something specific

This guide gives you a clean request approach and a “packet” you can share so the letter is detailed and aligned with your narrative.

## When to ask (the practical timeline)

A safe rule:

- Ask **4–8 weeks** before your first deadline (earlier is better)
- Follow up politely with reminders and confirmed submission instructions

Teachers get flooded with requests. Early asks increase quality and reduce stress.

## What to say (keep it simple)

Your request should include:

- Gratitude
- Why you’re asking them specifically
- Clear deadlines and instructions
- A short packet of context

## Packet

Copy/paste recommender packet checklist:

- [ ] 1-page brag sheet (2–3 proof points, growth, strengths)
- [ ] Resume/activity list
- [ ] Draft school list (or top targets) + deadlines
- [ ] Intended major/interests (1–2 sentences)
- [ ] Any context the teacher should know (brief, respectful)
- [ ] Submission instructions (portal/Common App/etc.)

Copy/paste request email:

Subject: Recommendation Letter Request — [Your Name]

Hi [Teacher Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I’m applying to college this year and I was wondering if you’d feel comfortable writing me a recommendation letter.

I’m asking you because [specific reason: how you know them / what they observed]. My first deadline is [date], and I would share a short packet with context (brag sheet, resume, deadlines) to make the process easier.

If you’re able to write for me, thank you — I really appreciate it. If your schedule is too full, I completely understand.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
[Class/Period]
