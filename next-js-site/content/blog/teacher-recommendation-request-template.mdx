Use this page if you're applying to college this year and want a complete, low-friction system for requesting a teacher rec — from the initial ask email to the context packet that helps them write a stronger letter.

Recommendation letters get stronger when you do two things:

- Ask early (with buffer)
- Make it easy for the teacher to write something specific

This guide gives you a clean request approach and a “packet” you can share so the letter is detailed and aligned with your narrative.

## When to ask (the practical timeline)

A safe rule:

- Ask **4–8 weeks** before your first deadline (earlier is better)
- Follow up politely with reminders and confirmed submission instructions

Teachers get flooded with requests. Early asks increase quality and reduce stress.

### Ask timeline by deadline type

| Deadline type | Ideal ask date | Latest safe ask date | Consequence of late ask |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early Decision (ED) | Late August / early September | Mid-September | Teacher scrambles; rushed letters tend to be generic |
| Early Action (EA) | Early September | Late September | Risk of teacher declining due to request volume; shorter write time |
| Regular Decision (RD) | October | Early November | Teacher may still accept, but you lose revision and follow-up buffer |
| Rolling admission | 6–8 weeks before target submission | 4 weeks before target | Late asks often get "I'll try" commitments with no deadline guarantee |

## What to say (keep it simple)

Your request should include:

- Gratitude
- Why you’re asking them specifically
- Clear deadlines and instructions
- A short packet of context

## Packet

Copy/paste recommender packet checklist:

- [ ] 1-page brag sheet (2–3 proof points, growth, strengths)
  *Good bullets are specific and show outcome. Examples:*
  - "Led redesign of school newspaper layout; print circulation +40% year over year"
  - "Tutored 3 freshmen in AP Chemistry weekly for two semesters; all passed the exam"
  - "Wrote and directed 10-minute student film selected for district arts festival (1 of 4 chosen)"
- [ ] Resume/activity list
- [ ] Draft school list (or top targets) + deadlines
- [ ] Intended major/interests (1–2 sentences)
- [ ] Any context the teacher should know (brief, respectful)
- [ ] Submission instructions (portal/Common App/etc.)

### What separates a good request from a generic one

Most students send vague asks. The two most common mistakes:

1. **No specific reason for choosing the teacher** — "I enjoy your class" is generic; it gives the teacher nothing to build on when writing the letter.
2. **No packet offer** — Without context (resume, brag sheet, deadlines), the teacher writes from memory, which tends to produce shorter, less specific letters.

**Weak request email (what most students send):**

> Subject: Recommendation Letter
>
> Hi Ms. Johnson,
>
> I was wondering if you could write me a college recommendation letter. I really enjoyed your class and think you know me well. Please let me know. Thanks!

**What's missing:** No specific reason why this teacher, no deadline mentioned, no packet offer — the teacher has no information to write from before saying yes.

**Strong request email (the version below):** Names exactly why you're asking this teacher, gives a firm first deadline, and offers a context packet upfront. The teacher knows what they're getting before they commit.

Copy/paste request email:

Subject: Recommendation Letter Request — [Your Name]

Hi [Teacher Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I’m applying to college this year and I was wondering if you’d feel comfortable writing me a recommendation letter.

I’m asking you because [specific reason: how you know them / what they observed]. My first deadline is [date], and I would share a short packet with context (brag sheet, resume, deadlines) to make the process easier.

If you’re able to write for me, thank you — I really appreciate it. If your schedule is too full, I completely understand.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
[Class/Period]

## What to do if the teacher says no or is unavailable

Teachers decline requests — for time, workload, or because they don't know you well enough to write a strong letter. Here's how to handle each scenario.

**If they give a soft decline ("I'm really busy this year"):**
Accept it graciously. Say something like: "I completely understand — thank you for letting me know." Then move to a backup. Soft declines are often genuine signals that the letter would not be strong anyway; a reluctant writer rarely produces your best rec.

**If they say yes but then go silent:**
Send one polite follow-up 2–3 weeks before the deadline. Reference the specific deadline date and offer to re-share your packet. After one follow-up, contact your school counselor if the submission is still missing one week before the deadline.

**How to identify a backup teacher without burning the relationship:**
Approach a backup teacher at the same time as your first ask, framing it as: "I'm asking two teachers in case either of you is fully booked — I wanted to give you both as much notice as possible." This is standard; most teachers understand.

**Whether to tell colleges:**
No. Do not proactively tell colleges if a teacher declines. Submit your two required recs normally. Colleges do not expect an explanation unless something unusual requires one (e.g., a counselor rec is missing due to a school closure). If directly asked, answer honestly.
