Most testing stress comes from one fear: “If I take it again and do worse, will that hurt me?”

The answer depends on two policy ideas that are easy to misunderstand:

- **Score Choice** (what you can choose to send)
- **Superscoring** (how schools combine section scores across sittings)

This guide explains both, how to read a school’s policy, and how to make a clean decision about what to send.

## Definitions (in plain English)

### Score Choice
**Score Choice** means you may be able to choose *which test dates* to send to a college (instead of automatically sending every sitting).

Important nuance:

- Some schools allow Score Choice for the SAT and/or ACT.
- Some schools require **all** scores from **all** sittings (policy varies).

### Superscoring
**Superscoring** means a school considers your **best section scores** across multiple test dates and combines them into a “superscore.”

Examples:

- SAT: best Math + best Evidence-Based Reading/Writing from different dates
- ACT: best English/Math/Reading/Science across different dates (and then a composite)

If a school superscores, one “bad day” usually matters less — but you still need to confirm what they require you to submit.

## Why Score Choice and superscoring change your retake strategy

If you understand the policy, you can make testing calmer:

- You don’t retake out of panic.
- You retake only when practice data shows real upside.
- You know whether a lower score will be visible (and if it matters).

## Step 1: Read the policy like a checklist (not like marketing)

On a school’s admissions/testing page, look for:

- **Do they accept SAT, ACT, or both?**
- **Do they superscore?**
- **Do they require all scores from all sittings?**
- **Do they require official score reports, or accept self-reporting?**
- **Any exceptions** (e.g., specific programs, scholarship consideration, international applicants)

If the language is vague, assume nothing. Policies can be inconsistent across pages — and they can change year to year.

## Step 2: Decide your “send strategy”

Here’s a practical decision tree.

### Case A: The school superscores and allows Score Choice
This is the most forgiving setup.

Your strategy:

- Retake only if practice tests show a realistic gain in a specific section
- Don’t stress about a slightly worse composite if you improved a section
- Send the sittings that create the best superscore

### Case B: The school superscores but requires all scores
Your score still superscores, but the school may see all sittings.

Your strategy:

- Be more selective about retakes
- Retake only when your practice tests are clearly above your prior score
- Avoid “hail mary” attempts without preparation

### Case C: The school does not superscore
In this case, the school usually evaluates your **best single sitting** (or their stated approach).

Your strategy:

- Focus on raising your overall performance on one date
- Retake only if you can improve the composite meaningfully
- Avoid too many sittings — diminishing returns are real

### Case D: Test-optional schools
Test-optional doesn’t mean “tests don’t matter.” It means you choose whether submitting a score helps.

Your strategy:

- Submit if your score strengthens your application relative to the school’s norms
- Go test-optional if the score distracts from stronger signals (GPA, rigor, impact, essays)

## Step 3: Build a clean retake rule (so testing doesn’t expand forever)

Retakes should be driven by evidence. Two useful stop rules:

- **Stop after you hit your target range** (top of the school’s middle 50%, not a single number)
- **Stop after two official tests** if practice tests plateau and your time is better spent on grades/essays

Testing is only one part of your application. Your plan should protect essay season and academic performance.

## Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

- **Mistake: retaking without reviewing error patterns.**  
  **Fix**: label misses as content vs timing vs careless, then practice accordingly.

- **Mistake: assuming superscoring means “nothing else matters.”**  
  **Fix**: confirm whether the school requires all sittings.

- **Mistake: sending official scores too early.**  
  **Fix**: self-report first when allowed; send official reports only when needed.

- **Mistake: chasing a perfect score at the expense of essays.**  
  **Fix**: use a stop rule. A slightly higher score rarely outweighs weaker writing.
