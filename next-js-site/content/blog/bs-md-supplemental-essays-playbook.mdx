BS/MD essays are different from standard “Why Major” writing.

Programs are evaluating not just interest, but **maturity, ethical awareness, and sustained commitment** — and they’re specifically looking for students who understand medicine as a real profession, not a prestige identity.

This guide gives you a practical structure for BS/MD supplements and the proof points that make your narrative credible.

## What BS/MD readers want to see

Strong BS/MD writing usually proves:

- **Sustained motivation** (not a one-week shadowing story)
- **Service maturity** (helping effectively, not performatively)
- **Clinical/research curiosity** (where appropriate and accessible)
- **Ethical awareness** (boundaries, humility, patient dignity)
- **Readiness** (you understand the training path and tradeoffs)

## The narrative arc that works

### 1) Origin (why health)
Name the real origin, but avoid melodrama. One moment can work — but only if it connects to sustained action.

### 2) Exploration (what you did)
Proof points matter more than feelings:

- service with responsibility
- long-term mentoring/tutoring
- research or projects (if available)
- credible learning (books, courses, structured programs)

### 3) Insight (what you learned about the work)
Strong essays show nuance:

- medicine is teamwork
- outcomes are complex
- ethics and equity matter
- emotional resilience is trained, not assumed

### 4) Fit (why this program)
Use specifics (curriculum, clinical exposure model, mentorship) and connect them to your trajectory.

### 5) Forward motion (how you’ll contribute)
End with a plan: what you’ll do in the program and what kind of physician/leader you aim to become.

## What to avoid (BS/MD clichés)

- “I’ve always wanted to be a doctor.”
- “I want to help people.” (without proof)
- Hero narratives or savior framing
- Overstating clinical experience you didn’t actually have

The strongest essays are grounded, specific, and humble — with real work behind them.
