Flagship and honors supplements often look “easier” than Ivy+ prompts — but many applicants still underperform because they write generic ambition essays (“I want opportunities”).

Strong honors writing is concrete:

- what you’ve already done,
- what you want to do next,
- and why the program’s specific resources match your trajectory.

This guide gives you structures for the most common flagship/honors prompt types.

## Common honors prompt families

### 1) “Why honors?”
The job: show you understand what the program is and how you’ll use it.

Structure:

1. Fit thesis (what you want to study/build)
2. 2–3 program specifics (research, seminars, thesis, cohort, advising)
3. What you’ll do with them (a plan)
4. Contribution (how you’ll strengthen the cohort/community)

### 2) Leadership / impact
The job: prove responsibility and results.

Use:
Context → Action → Outcome → Reflection → Campus transfer.

### 3) Community / service / contribution
The job: show you contribute effectively (not performatively).

Use:
Problem → What you did → What changed → What you learned → What you’ll do on campus.

## The biggest honors essay mistake: “opportunity” with no plan

Replace “I want opportunities” with:

- one academic path (classes, research, thesis),
- one community path (orgs, impact),
- and one deliverable you want to ship (project, research output, program).
