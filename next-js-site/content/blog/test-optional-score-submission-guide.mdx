This post answers one specific question: you have a score — should you submit it to school X? It covers the decision framework, how policies vary by institution, and why financial aid considerations can flip the default answer.

It does not cover how to prep for the SAT or ACT (see [SAT vs ACT Guide](/blog/when-to-take-sat-vs-act)) or how to handle multiple scores and superscoring (see [Score Choice & Superscoring Guide](/blog/score-choice-superscoring-guide)).

## What "test-optional" actually means (and what it doesn't)

Under most test-optional policies, you won't be penalized for not submitting a score — though policies vary by school and year; confirm the current policy directly with each school before applying. Test-optional does not mean scores are irrelevant — a strong score still strengthens your application.

There are three distinct policies you'll encounter:

- **Test-optional** — you choose whether to submit; no submission carries no explicit penalty. Most schools fall here.
- **Test-blind** — scores are never reviewed even if submitted. Examples: Caltech (undergrad), some liberal arts colleges. Submitting is wasted effort.
- **Test-flexible** — you can substitute other evidence (AP scores, IB results, SAT Subject Tests) in place of the SAT/ACT.

One detail many students miss: admissions officers can see that you didn't submit a score. They won't penalize you outright, but a gap in testing can shift weight onto other parts of your file — GPA trajectory, course rigor, rec letters. If those areas are strong, no problem. If they're not, a withheld score won't save you.

<span id="percentile-threshold"></span>
## The core decision rule: the percentile threshold

The standard rule: **submit if your score is at or above the school's 50th percentile for enrolled students.**

The 50th percentile is the midpoint of the school's enrolled score distribution — not the top of the "middle 50%" range. If half the enrolled class scored at or below that number, your score at that level is solidly in range.

**Where to find this data:**
- The school's Common Data Set (search "[School Name] Common Data Set [year]" — look for Section C9)
- The school's own testing or class profile page
- Naviance, College Board BigFuture, or Prepscholar's school profiles

Here's how it plays out:

| Your score | School's 50th percentile | Submit? |
|---|---|---|
| 1480 SAT | 1450 | ✅ Submit |
| 1480 SAT | 1510 | ❌ Withhold |
| 32 ACT | 33 | ❌ Withhold |
| 32 ACT | 30 | ✅ Submit |

The logic is straightforward: a score above the 50th percentile adds positive context. A score below it pulls your application in the wrong direction without adding anything useful.

<span id="when-rule-breaks-down"></span>
## When the percentile rule breaks down

The 50th-percentile rule is a reliable default, but four situations complicate it.

**1. You're borderline (within 20 SAT points of the 50th percentile)**

A score 10–20 points below the midpoint isn't automatically a liability. Context matters: if you're applying to a program with lower average scores (education vs. engineering at the same school), or if your state residency, major, or background factors are likely to help you, the borderline score is less damaging. Run the rest of your application first — if it's strong everywhere else, the borderline score is unlikely to hurt you much.

**2. The school is test-blind**

Don't submit. Caltech (undergrad) and a handful of LACs fall into this category — but test-blind designations can and do change; verify the current policy directly with each school before withholding. There is no upside to submitting to a genuinely test-blind school, and it adds paperwork.

**3. Financial aid or merit scholarships require a score**

This is the most common reason to override the percentile rule — covered in full in the next section.

**4. The program has a separate score threshold**

Direct-admit nursing, engineering, and business programs at many universities use score cutoffs independently of the general admissions office. Check program-specific requirements, not just the school-wide data.

<span id="financial-aid"></span>
## Financial aid changes the math

Merit scholarships at many schools are explicitly score-indexed. A common structure: you need a 1400+ SAT to qualify for a $20,000/year renewable award. If you withhold a score that clears the threshold, you don't get the money — even if your GPA would otherwise make you competitive.

**Always check the school's merit aid thresholds before deciding to withhold.**

This information lives on the school's financial aid or scholarships page, not the admissions page. Search "[School Name] merit scholarship requirements" and look for a score cutoff in the eligibility criteria.

Here's what this looks like in practice: Jayla has a 1390 SAT. School X's 50th percentile is 1430, so the percentile rule says withhold. But School X's merit aid starts at 1360. Jayla submits — and qualifies for a $15,000/year award that changes the affordability of her decision.

The percentile rule optimizes for admissions probability. The financial aid check optimizes for cost. Run both before you decide.

<span id="decision-routing-table"></span>
## Decision routing table

Use this as your final check before each school on your list:

| My score vs. school's 50th percentile | School type | Financial aid priority | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Above 50th percentile | Any | Any | ✅ Submit |
| At or within 20 pts below | Highly selective | Need-based | Withhold unless application is strong in other areas |
| At or within 20 pts below | Mid-tier | Merit aid available | Check merit thresholds — may be worth submitting |
| Below 50th percentile by 30+ pts | Any | Any | ❌ Withhold |
| Score not yet taken | Any | Any | Don't rush — take the test if time allows |

A few notes on using this table:

- "Highly selective" = schools with sub-20% acceptance rates. At those schools, every data point gets scrutinized; a below-median score under a test-optional policy is unlikely to help and may invite questions about why you submitted it.
- "Mid-tier" schools often use test scores as a merit-aid lever more aggressively than selective schools. The calculus is different.
- If time allows and you haven't tested, taking the SAT or ACT is almost always worth it — you preserve optionality and keep the merit aid door open.

## Edge cases and common mistakes

**"I retook the test and my score went down."**

This is less of a problem than it feels. Superscoring — combining your best section scores across multiple sittings — is standard practice at most schools, so the question is rarely "which sitting do I report?" but "what is my superscore, and how does that compare to the school's 50th percentile?" If your superscore clears the threshold, submit. If it doesn't, withhold. Verify whether each school you're applying to uses superscoring; a handful still evaluate the highest single sitting instead.

**"I have both an SAT score and an ACT score."**

You don't have to submit both, and you shouldn't default to submitting both. Convert each score to the other scale using the College Board's concordance table, then compare each converted score against the school's 50th percentile. Submit whichever score performs better relative to that school's enrolled data. Some schools will evaluate both if submitted — meaning a weaker second score can add noise — so only include a second test if it also clears the threshold.

**"My score is in the 'middle 50%' — does that mean it's at the 50th percentile?"**

No. The middle 50% is the range between the 25th and 75th percentile of enrolled scores. The 50th percentile — the median — sits at the midpoint of that range. If a school's middle 50% is 1380–1500, the 50th percentile is roughly 1440. A score of 1390 is inside the middle 50% range but still below the median. The submit/withhold threshold in this guide is the 50th percentile (the median), not the bottom of the middle 50% band.

<span id="scenario"></span>
## Walking through the decision: Jasmine's case

Jasmine is a junior finishing her college list. She has a 1410 SAT superscore and eight schools to evaluate. Here's how she works through the framework.

**School 1 — Target (50th percentile: 1370).** Jasmine's 1410 is 40 points above the median. The percentile rule is clear: submit. Her score is an asset here, not a liability.

**School 2 — Target (50th percentile: 1390).** Same logic. Her score is above the 50th percentile by 20 points. Submit.

**School 3 — Reach (50th percentile: 1500).** Her 1410 is 90 points below the median. Submitting puts a below-median data point in front of an already-competitive reader stack. Withhold.

**School 4 — Reach (50th percentile: 1470).** Her score is 60 points below the median. Withhold. Even though this feels "closer," the gap at highly selective schools carries more weight than the raw number suggests.

**School 5 — Test-blind.** Jasmine checks the school's current policy directly — it is test-blind this cycle. She does not submit. Sending a score to a test-blind school accomplishes nothing and creates unnecessary paperwork.

**School 6 — Mid-tier with merit aid indexed to 1380+.** Her 1410 clears the merit threshold. The school's 50th percentile is 1430, so by the percentile rule she'd normally withhold. But the merit aid check flips the answer: submitting qualifies her for a renewable $16,000/year award. She submits and notes to verify the aid threshold before the deadline.

**School 7 — Borderline (50th percentile: 1420).** Her 1410 is 10 points below the median — within the borderline band. Jasmine reviews the rest of her file. Her GPA trajectory is strong, her extracurriculars are substantive, and her recommendations are solid. She decides to submit: the gap is small, her file is strong elsewhere, and being within 20 points of the median means the score adds context rather than dragging her down.

**School 8 — She hasn't taken the test yet.** The deadline is four months away. Jasmine registers for the next SAT administration. If her score comes back above the 50th percentile, she'll submit. If not, she'll withhold. She keeps the option open rather than defaulting to no-score by inaction.
