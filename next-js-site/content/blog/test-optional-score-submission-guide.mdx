This post answers one specific question: you have a score — should you submit it to school X? It covers the decision framework, how policies vary by institution, and why financial aid considerations can flip the default answer.

It does not cover how to prep for the SAT or ACT (see [SAT vs ACT Guide](/blog/when-to-take-sat-vs-act)) or how to handle multiple scores and superscoring (see [Score Choice & Superscoring Guide](/blog/score-choice-superscoring-guide)).

## What "test-optional" actually means (and what it doesn't)

Test-optional means you won't be penalized for not submitting a score. It does not mean scores are irrelevant — a strong score still strengthens your application.

There are three distinct policies you'll encounter:

- **Test-optional** — you choose whether to submit; no submission carries no explicit penalty. Most schools fall here.
- **Test-blind** — scores are never reviewed even if submitted. Examples: Caltech (undergrad), some liberal arts colleges. Submitting is wasted effort.
- **Test-flexible** — you can substitute other evidence (AP scores, IB results, SAT Subject Tests) in place of the SAT/ACT.

One detail many students miss: admissions officers can see that you didn't submit a score. They won't penalize you outright, but a gap in testing can shift weight onto other parts of your file — GPA trajectory, course rigor, rec letters. If those areas are strong, no problem. If they're not, a withheld score won't save you.

<span id="percentile-threshold"></span>
## The core decision rule: the percentile threshold

The standard rule: **submit if your score is at or above the school's 50th percentile for enrolled students.**

The 50th percentile is the midpoint of the school's enrolled score distribution — not the top of the "middle 50%" range. If half the enrolled class scored at or below that number, your score at that level is solidly in range.

**Where to find this data:**
- The school's Common Data Set (search "[School Name] Common Data Set [year]" — look for Section C9)
- The school's own testing or class profile page
- Naviance, College Board BigFuture, or Prepscholar's school profiles

Here's how it plays out:

| Your score | School's 50th percentile | Submit? |
|---|---|---|
| 1480 SAT | 1450 | ✅ Submit |
| 1480 SAT | 1510 | ❌ Withhold |
| 32 ACT | 33 | ❌ Withhold |
| 32 ACT | 30 | ✅ Submit |

The logic is straightforward: a score above the 50th percentile adds positive context. A score below it pulls your application in the wrong direction without adding anything useful.

<span id="when-rule-breaks-down"></span>
## When the percentile rule breaks down

The 50th-percentile rule is a reliable default, but four situations complicate it.

**1. You're borderline (within 20 SAT points of the 50th percentile)**

A score 10–20 points below the midpoint isn't automatically a liability. Context matters: if you're applying to a program with lower average scores (education vs. engineering at the same school), or if your state residency, major, or background factors are likely to help you, the borderline score is less damaging. Run the rest of your application first — if it's strong everywhere else, the borderline score is unlikely to hurt you much.

**2. The school is test-blind**

Don't submit. Caltech, MIT (undergrad), and a handful of LACs never read scores. There is no upside to submitting, and it adds paperwork.

**3. Financial aid or merit scholarships require a score**

This is the most common reason to override the percentile rule — covered in full in the next section.

**4. The program has a separate score threshold**

Direct-admit nursing, engineering, and business programs at many universities use score cutoffs independently of the general admissions office. Check program-specific requirements, not just the school-wide data.

<span id="financial-aid"></span>
## Financial aid changes the math

Merit scholarships at many schools are explicitly score-indexed. A common structure: you need a 1400+ SAT to qualify for a $20,000/year renewable award. If you withhold a score that clears the threshold, you don't get the money — even if your GPA would otherwise make you competitive.

**Always check the school's merit aid thresholds before deciding to withhold.**

This information lives on the school's financial aid or scholarships page, not the admissions page. Search "[School Name] merit scholarship requirements" and look for a score cutoff in the eligibility criteria.

Here's what this looks like in practice: Jayla has a 1390 SAT. School X's 50th percentile is 1430, so the percentile rule says withhold. But School X's merit aid starts at 1360. Jayla submits — and qualifies for a $15,000/year award that changes the affordability of her decision.

The percentile rule optimizes for admissions probability. The financial aid check optimizes for cost. Run both before you decide.

<span id="decision-routing-table"></span>
## Decision routing table

Use this as your final check before each school on your list:

| My score vs. school's 50th percentile | School type | Financial aid priority | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Above 50th percentile | Any | Any | ✅ Submit |
| At or within 20 pts below | Highly selective | Need-based | Withhold unless application is strong in other areas |
| At or within 20 pts below | Mid-tier | Merit aid available | Check merit thresholds — may be worth submitting |
| Below 50th percentile by 30+ pts | Any | Any | ❌ Withhold |
| Score not yet taken | Any | Any | Don't rush — take the test if time allows |

A few notes on using this table:

- "Highly selective" = schools with sub-20% acceptance rates. At those schools, every data point gets scrutinized; a below-median score under a test-optional policy is unlikely to help and may invite questions about why you submitted it.
- "Mid-tier" schools often use test scores as a merit-aid lever more aggressively than selective schools. The calculus is different.
- If time allows and you haven't tested, taking the SAT or ACT is almost always worth it — you preserve optionality and keep the merit aid door open.
