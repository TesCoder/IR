Recommendation letters don’t help because they’re positive.

They help because they’re **specific**: they show how you think, how you contribute, and how you handle challenge — from an adult who has observed you consistently.

This guide helps you choose recommenders who can write strong letters, align letters with your narrative, and avoid the most common mistakes.

## What makes a recommendation “strong”

A strong recommender can credibly say:

- what you’re like in a real environment (classroom, team, lab)
- how you think and learn
- what you did that stood out (with examples)
- how you grew over time

Generic praise (“hard-working, nice”) is not a strong letter.

## Who to choose (the practical criteria)

### Choose teachers who:
- Know you well (not just your grade)
- Can describe specific moments of contribution or growth
- Teach a core academic subject (most schools prefer this)
- Are likely to write clearly and on time

### Often a strong default pair is:
- One **STEM** teacher (math/science)
- One **humanities** teacher (English/history/social science)

This gives breadth and credibility.

## When “famous” recommenders hurt more than they help

Families sometimes chase:

- a prestigious title,
- a coach with a big reputation,
- a professor you met once.

Unless the person truly knows you well, these letters tend to be generic and weak — and admissions readers can tell.

Specificity beats status.

## How to align recommenders with your narrative

Ask: “What part of my story can this person prove?”

Examples:

- A teacher who saw you lead discussion and mentor peers
- A teacher who watched you iterate after a low first exam
- A teacher who can describe your curiosity and initiative beyond assignments

Ideally, your recommenders don’t write the same letter twice. You want complementary proof.

## Timeline: ask earlier than you feel comfortable

A practical rule:

- Ask **at least 4–6 weeks** before your first deadline (earlier is better)
- Provide materials immediately (so the letter is specific)
- Follow up politely with enough buffer

## What to give your recommender (your “packet”)

Give them:

- A 1-page brag sheet (proof points, growth, interests)
- Your resume/activity list
- A short note on your intended major/interests
- Any specific school deadlines and submission instructions

This makes the letter more detailed and reduces stress for them.
