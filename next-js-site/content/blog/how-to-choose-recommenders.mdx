Recommendation letters don’t help because they’re positive.

They help because they’re **specific**: they show how you think, how you contribute, and how you handle challenge — from an adult who has observed you consistently.

This guide helps you choose recommenders who can write strong letters, align letters with your narrative, and avoid the most common mistakes.

By the end of this guide, you’ll know how to:

- choose recommenders who can write with *examples* (not labels)
- ask early without awkwardness (timeline + follow-ups)
- give a simple “packet” that makes letters more detailed and on-time

Before you pick people, take 2 minutes to check each college’s recommendation rules. Requirements vary: some schools want two teacher letters (often junior-year/core), some require a counselor letter, and “optional” additional letters can help or hurt depending on fit. Use this guide to choose the strongest recommenders *within* those rules.

## What makes a recommendation “strong”

A strong recommender can credibly say:

- what you’re like in a real environment (classroom, team, lab)
- how you think and learn
- what you did that stood out (with examples)
- how you grew over time

Generic praise (“hard-working, nice”) is not a strong letter.

## Who to choose (the practical criteria)

### Choose teachers who:
- Know you well (not just your grade)
- Can describe specific moments of contribution or growth
- Teach a core academic subject (most schools prefer this)
- Are likely to write clearly and on time

### Often a strong default pair is:
- One **STEM** teacher (math/science)
- One **humanities** teacher (English/history/social science)

This gives breadth and credibility.

### A quick scoring rubric (pick the highest total)
If you’re deciding between a few “pretty good” options, score each person 1–5 on:

- **Closeness**: how well they know you day-to-day
- **Recency**: how recently they taught/coached/managed you
- **Evidence**: how many specific stories/examples they can tell
- **Reliability**: will they write clearly and on time?

Choose the top 1–2 totals that also match your schools’ requirements.

## When “famous” recommenders hurt more than they help

Families sometimes chase:

- a prestigious title,
- a coach with a big reputation,
- a professor you met once.

Unless the person truly knows you well, these letters tend to be generic and weak — and admissions readers can tell.

Specificity beats status.

## How to align recommenders with your narrative

Ask: “What part of my story can this person prove?”

Examples:

- A teacher who saw you lead discussion and mentor peers
- A teacher who watched you iterate after a low first exam
- A teacher who can describe your curiosity and initiative beyond assignments

Ideally, your recommenders don’t write the same letter twice. You want complementary proof.

## Timeline: ask earlier than you feel comfortable

A practical rule:

- Ask **at least 4–6 weeks** before your first deadline (earlier is better)
- Provide materials immediately (so the letter is specific)
- Follow up politely with enough buffer

If you want a ready-to-send ask email, use the [Teacher Recommendation Request Template](/blog/teacher-recommendation-request-template).

## What to give your recommender (your “packet”)

Give them:

- A 1-page brag sheet (proof points, growth, interests)
- Your resume/activity list
- A short note on your intended major/interests
- Any specific school deadlines and submission instructions

This makes the letter more detailed and reduces stress for them.

Optional (high-impact) prompts to include in your brag sheet:

- **1–2 moments they might remember**: a project, discussion, lab, performance, or challenge (with 1 sentence on what you did).
- **Growth story**: what you improved over time and what changed in your approach.
- **How you show up**: how you contribute to class/community (mentoring, leadership, curiosity, consistency).
- **What you want the reader to understand**: 2–3 traits you hope the letter supports *with proof points* (not adjectives alone).

These prompts aren’t about scripting the letter — they’re memory-joggers that help your recommender be specific.

## Quick FAQ

### Can I submit an extra recommendation letter?
Only if it adds **new, specific information** that isn’t already in your application (e.g., a research mentor who can speak to independent work). If it’s likely to be generic or repetitive, skip it — and always follow each school’s policy.

### What if I only have one “great” teacher?
Pick the strongest one, then choose the next best option who can still provide **examples** and meets requirements (even if you’re less close). A second “solid + specific” letter beats a prestigious name who barely knows you.

### Should I ask a coach/employer/professor instead?
Ask them only if (1) the college allows it and (2) they can provide **complementary proof** (leadership, teamwork, initiative) that teachers can’t. In most cases, prioritize core academic teachers first.
