Appealing a financial aid offer is a structured request backed by new, verifiable information—not “begging.” The strongest appeals pair concise narrative with documents the aid office can act on.

Note: This is general education, not financial advice. Follow each school’s process.

## When to appeal and what counts as “new information”

- Income change (job loss/reduction, business downturn) documented with dates and amounts
- Major expenses: medical bills, emergency repairs, or caregiving costs
- Sibling now enrolled in college (with enrollment verification)
- One-time income that inflates FAFSA/CSS (explain and document)
- Comparable offers from peer schools with similar selectivity and profile

## Required documents & how to present them

- Income change: recent pay stubs + employer letter with start/end dates and expected income
- Medical/extraordinary expenses: itemized bills, receipts, and insurance explanations of benefits
- Business change: brief P&L excerpt or accountant letter summarizing the downturn
- Sibling in college: current enrollment verification plus tuition/billing statement
- Comparable offers: PDF award letters with net cost highlighted
- Cover note: a 3–5 bullet summary labeling each attachment and the exact gap you need to close

## Sample appeal letter (verbatim-ready, 3 short paragraphs)

Subject: Financial Aid Reconsideration Request — [Student Name], [ID if available]

Dear [Financial Aid Officer],

Thank you for your offer. I am writing to request a review of our family’s financial circumstances due to [concise reason + date]. Enclosed are documents that were not considered originally.

Our estimated net cost is [\$X/year]; our feasible budget is [\$Y/year]. The attached items include [brief list of documents] to reflect our current situation. If there is flexibility to adjust need-based grant aid or merit, we would be grateful for a reconsideration.

Thank you for your time and guidance. Please let me know if any additional documentation would be helpful.

## What to expect after submitting

- Typical response window: 1–3 weeks; faster if deadlines are near
- The aid office may request additional documents—reply with the same labels you used in your cover note
- Outcomes: grant/merit adjustment, loan substitution, or “no change” (ask if re-review is possible after new info)
- Keep copies of everything and check the portal/email for status changes
