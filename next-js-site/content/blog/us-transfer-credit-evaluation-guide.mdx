Many transfer students focus on getting admitted — and then get surprised by the credit evaluation. Credit mapping determines whether you can graduate on time, keep your major, and avoid extra semesters.

Use this guide if you're a transfer applicant mapping credits for a specific target school or major—especially if you're worried about losing time or missing prerequisite sequences.

## What admissions vs registrar evaluates
- Admissions: academic fit, trajectory, and whether your plan is realistic.
- Registrar/department: course-by-course equivalency, syllabi, contact hours, and articulation agreements.
- Competitive majors often add caps or sequencing rules (STEM/business/portfolio programs).

## How to prepare syllabi and course descriptions (checklist)
- Official and unofficial transcripts.
- Course titles + credit hours/units with term taken.
- Syllabi for major prerequisites with weekly topics, learning outcomes, reading list, assessment methods, and contact hours.
- Course descriptions (catalog text) and links to any articulation agreements.
- Store PDFs; “Syllabus checklist: course title, weekly topics, learning outcomes, reading list, assessment methods, contact hours.”

## When to request pre-evaluation vs post-admit evaluation
- **Pre-evaluation:** use published articulation agreements, advising appointments, or departmental emails to estimate what will transfer before you apply. Helps you pick targets and course loads.
- **Post-admit evaluation:** official review after you commit/submit final transcripts; expect to supply syllabi and contact hours. Note any caps or residency requirements that limit how many upper-division credits can transfer.

## Quick case studies: likely outcomes
- Calculus I–II from a community college to a STEM major: often accepted if syllabi show contact hours and sequence alignment; labs/recitations matter.
- Business statistics from a non-accredited provider: may land as elective only; provide a syllabus with assessments and tools (e.g., Excel/R) to improve odds.
- Writing/GE course with no syllabus: often denied or converted to elective; request department guidance and be ready with documentation.

## Marcus's walkthrough: UC Davis → Carnegie Mellon (CS transfer)

Marcus is a junior at UC Davis transferring to Carnegie Mellon as a CS major. He starts credit mapping during fall of his junior year — six months before applications open, not after admits arrive.

**His three priority courses:**

| Course | UC Davis course | Grade | CMU equivalent sought | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Calculus I | MAT 21A (4 semester units) | A | 21-120 Differential and Integral Calculus | Major prerequisite |
| Data Structures | ECS 60 (4 semester units) | B+ | 15-121 Introduction to Data Structures | Major prerequisite |
| Technical Writing | UWP 104E (4 semester units) | A− | Writing requirement (WR) | General education |

**Pre-evaluation phase (before he applies)**

Marcus searches CMU's transfer credit database and CS department advising pages. Here is what he finds and how he responds:

- *Calculus I:* UC Davis's MAT 21A covers the same topics as CMU's 21-120 (limits, derivatives, integrals, contact hours). He saves the MAT 21A syllabus showing a 150-minute weekly lecture plus weekly discussion — the documentation he will need at the post-admit stage. He flags this as low risk.
- *Data Structures:* No direct articulation agreement exists. CMU's 15-121 requires C++; Marcus's ECS 60 also used C++. He emails the CMU CS undergraduate advising office to request a pre-evaluation and attaches his full syllabus — weekly topics, two major coding projects, and a list of data structures covered (linked lists, trees, hash maps, graphs). The advisor confirms informally that equivalency is likely if the formal syllabus matches.
- *Technical Writing:* No match exists in the transfer database. A CMU advisor warns him that non-CMU writing courses frequently land as free elective credit unless syllabi demonstrate research writing tasks. Marcus notes this risk and saves his course syllabus plus the description of a research report assignment he completed — that document will matter at the post-admit stage.

**Post-admit evaluation phase (after he commits)**

After CMU admits Marcus and he submits his enrollment deposit, the registrar initiates a formal Transfer Credit Evaluation:

1. The registrar requests official transcripts and a completed Transfer Credit Evaluation form listing each course Marcus wants reviewed.
2. Marcus submits the MAT 21A syllabus. The evaluator confirms MAT 21A = 21-120 (6 CMU units, major prerequisite satisfied). ✅
3. For Data Structures, the CS department reviews his ECS 60 syllabus and project artifacts. They confirm equivalency to 15-121 (major prerequisite satisfied). ✅
4. For Technical Writing, Marcus submits both the syllabus and his research report assignment description. The department grants WR credit — but only because the assignment description proved research-writing tasks were required. Without that single document, the course would have defaulted to free elective credit and left him with an unmet WR requirement. ✅

**What Marcus catches early through pre-evaluation:**

CMU caps external transfer credits for CS majors at 60 units. Marcus's 128 UC Davis quarter units translate to roughly 45 CMU units after evaluation — safely under the cap. He also confirms that CMU's required course 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation) has no transfer equivalent and plans to take it in his first CMU semester. Catching this in fall — before he committed — lets him build it into his four-year plan rather than discover it after orientation.

**The lesson:** Pre-evaluation catches credit gaps before you're committed. Post-admit evaluation is official — but the syllabi and assignment documentation you gathered pre-evaluation is exactly what the registrar will ask for. A course without documentation defaults to elective credit. A course with documentation has a real path to prerequisite equivalency.

## Build a simple credit map
- Columns: your course, credits/units, category (GE/major/elective), possible equivalent at target school, evidence link (syllabus/description), notes (needs review/unclear/not accepted).
- Add prerequisite sequencing so you know if you’ll lose time even when credits “transfer.”

## Avoid the common transfer-credit traps
- Assuming “credit transfers” means “major transfers” — electives don’t satisfy prerequisites.
- Ignoring caps or residency rules that force extra semesters.
- Failing to save syllabi; without them, equivalency decisions often default to elective credit.
