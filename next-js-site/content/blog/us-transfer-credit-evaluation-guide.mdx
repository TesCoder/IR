Many transfer students focus on getting admitted — and then get surprised by the credit evaluation. Credit mapping determines whether you can graduate on time, keep your major, and avoid extra semesters.

## What admissions vs registrar evaluates
- Admissions: academic fit, trajectory, and whether your plan is realistic.
- Registrar/department: course-by-course equivalency, syllabi, contact hours, and articulation agreements.
- Competitive majors often add caps or sequencing rules (STEM/business/portfolio programs).

## How to prepare syllabi and course descriptions (checklist)
- Official and unofficial transcripts.
- Course titles + credit hours/units with term taken.
- Syllabi for major prerequisites with weekly topics, learning outcomes, reading list, assessment methods, and contact hours.
- Course descriptions (catalog text) and links to any articulation agreements.
- Store PDFs; “Syllabus checklist: course title, weekly topics, learning outcomes, reading list, assessment methods, contact hours.”

## When to request pre-evaluation vs post-admit evaluation
- **Pre-evaluation:** use published articulation agreements, advising appointments, or departmental emails to estimate what will transfer before you apply. Helps you pick targets and course loads.
- **Post-admit evaluation:** official review after you commit/submit final transcripts; expect to supply syllabi and contact hours. Note any caps or residency requirements that limit how many upper-division credits can transfer.

## Quick case studies: likely outcomes
- Calculus I–II from a community college to a STEM major: often accepted if syllabi show contact hours and sequence alignment; labs/recitations matter.
- Business statistics from a non-accredited provider: may land as elective only; provide a syllabus with assessments and tools (e.g., Excel/R) to improve odds.
- Writing/GE course with no syllabus: often denied or converted to elective; request department guidance and be ready with documentation.

## Build a simple credit map
- Columns: your course, credits/units, category (GE/major/elective), possible equivalent at target school, evidence link (syllabus/description), notes (needs review/unclear/not accepted).
- Add prerequisite sequencing so you know if you’ll lose time even when credits “transfer.”

## Avoid the common transfer-credit traps
- Assuming “credit transfers” means “major transfers” — electives don’t satisfy prerequisites.
- Ignoring caps or residency rules that force extra semesters.
- Failing to save syllabi; without them, equivalency decisions often default to elective credit.
