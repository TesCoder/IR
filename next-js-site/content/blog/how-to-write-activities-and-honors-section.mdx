Admissions readers don’t “deep read” your activities list. They scan it.

That’s why vague entries (“helped,” “assisted,” “participated”) quietly weaken strong students. The reader can’t tell what you actually did, how serious it was, or what changed because you showed up.

This guide gives you a repeatable formula for writing activities and honors entries that feel specific, measurable, and credible — plus a copy/paste bullet bank.

Use this guide if you’re writing your Common App Activities or Honors section and want specific, credible bullets — fast.

## What the activities section is really for

Your activities list should make a reader quickly understand:

- **What you chose to do** (and why it fits you)
- **How you contributed** (responsibility and ownership)
- **What changed** (outcomes, scale, proof)
- **Growth over time** (progression, leadership, specialization)

It’s less about “listing everything” and more about showing a coherent pattern.

## The bullet formula that works

When you’re stuck, use this structure:

**Action verb + what you did + how you did it + scope + outcome.**

Examples:

- “Led weekly tutoring block; designed 6-week curriculum; served 28 students; improved quiz averages by 12%.”
- “Built volunteer scheduling system; reduced no-shows 30%; trained 9 new volunteers.”

If you can’t add scope or outcome yet, that’s not a writing problem — it’s a documentation problem. Start tracking now.

## How to quantify without exaggerating

Good quantification is simple and honest:

- People served / participants
- Frequency (weekly, monthly)
- Duration (months/years)
- Output (projects shipped, articles published, events run)
- Growth (before → after)

Avoid fuzzy numbers. Small, accurate metrics beat inflated claims.

## Examples by activity type

### Leadership (clubs / orgs)
Strong:
“Recruited and trained 14 volunteers; launched 3 outreach events; grew attendance 18→52.”

Weak:
“VP — helped run meetings.”

### Research / academic work
Strong:
“Coded data-cleaning pipeline (Python); analyzed 3,200 samples; co-authored poster presented at regional symposium.”

### Work / family responsibilities
Strong:
“Managed weekend shifts; trained 5 new staff; handled inventory; reduced restock errors by 20%.”

### Sports / arts
Strong:
“Captain; led 2x/week drills; mentored 6 underclassmen; team improved league placement (8th→3rd).”

## Activity-type routing: matching verbs to your role type

Not all activity types call for the same language. Use this table to identify which verb category fits your role and what kind of impact framing readers find most credible.

| Activity type | Best verb categories | Impact framing that works | Weak framing to avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Leadership role (officer, captain, chair) | Led, recruited, trained, chaired, facilitated | Scope (team size), growth metric (before → after), decisions you owned | “Helped lead,” “assisted with,” generic titles |
| Individual achievement (research, competition, independent project) | Analyzed, built, designed, published, earned | Output produced, recognition level, methodology used | “Worked on,” “participated in,” vague scope |
| Service / community (tutoring, volunteering, outreach) | Served, coordinated, delivered, scheduled, executed | People impacted, frequency, measurable community change | “Helped out,” hours-only framing without outcomes |
| Creative / arts (music, visual art, writing, theater) | Composed, performed, directed, exhibited, published | Audience size, venues, output volume (pieces, shows), awards | “Played,” “drew,” activity with no scale or output |

**How to use this:** Find your activity type in the left column. Pull 2–3 verbs from the “Best verb categories” column. Then check your draft — if your impact framing matches the third column, you’re on track.

## The honors section: what to include

Honors should be:

- **Accurate** (name + level)
- **Legible** (what it is, if not obvious)
- **Contextual** (school, regional, national)

Examples:

- “National Merit Commended Student (national)”
- “State Science Fair — 2nd place (state)”
- “AP Scholar with Distinction (national)”

If an award name is niche, add one clarifying word.

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Mistake: writing job descriptions.**  
  **Fix**: write outcomes. What changed because you did the job?

- **Mistake: repeating the same verb (“helped”).**  
  **Fix**: use specific verbs tied to ownership (built, led, launched, designed).

- **Mistake: listing too many low-impact activities.**  
  **Fix**: prioritize depth and proof; cut redundancy.

## Walkthrough: Jordan applies the formula to 3 activities and 1 honor

Jordan is a high school senior with 8 activities and 3 honors. She’s strong in math and science, runs a community tutoring program she founded in 10th grade, and has played violin for six years. Her first draft uses passive language and job-description phrasing throughout. Here’s how the formula transforms each entry.

### Activity 1 — Math Club President (leadership role)

**Before:**
“Served as President of Math Club. Helped organize meetings and competitions.”

**Why this is weak:** No scope, no outcomes. “Helped organize” signals low ownership. A reader can’t tell if this is 8 members or 80, or whether it went anywhere.

**After:**
“Grew Math Club membership 11→34 members over 2 years; launched interscholastic competition team; placed 2nd at regional Math Olympiad.”

**What changed:** Verb upgraded (grew, launched), scope added (11→34 members), outcome added (regional placement). Ownership is now visible.

### Activity 2 — Community Tutoring Program Founder (service / community)

**Before:**
“Started a tutoring program for middle school students.”

**Why this is weak:** No frequency, no scale, no outcome. “Started” sounds like it could be a single session.

**After:**
“Founded weekly tutoring program; coordinated 6 volunteer tutors; served 22 middle school students per semester; participants averaged one letter-grade improvement in math.”

**What changed:** Service framing applied — people impacted (22 students), frequency (weekly), measurable change (letter-grade improvement). The founding moment is now supported by ongoing proof.

### Activity 3 — Violin, Youth Symphony Orchestra (creative / arts)

**Before:**
“Played violin in youth orchestra for 4 years.”

**Why this is weak:** Duration alone is not impact. No venue, no audience, no role progression.

**After:**
“Section leader, youth symphony orchestra (4 years); performed in 12 public concerts; selected for regional all-state audition (top 15 of 80 applicants).”

**What changed:** Arts framing applied — role progression (section leader), output volume (12 concerts), competitive selection signal (top 15 of 80).

---

### Honor 1 — Science Fair Award

**Before:**
“Science fair winner.”

**Why this is weak:** No level (school vs. regional vs. national), no category, no credibility marker.

**After:**
“Regional Science Fair — 1st place, Engineering category (regional; 140 entries).”

**What changed:** Level added (regional), category added, context added (140 entries). Now a reader can quickly assess what “winner” actually means.

## What if you have fewer than 5 meaningful activities?

This is more common than students realize — and it does not disqualify you.

**What counts as an activity?** More than most students assume:

- A consistent informal role (babysitting siblings weekly, managing a family business task, translating for parents)
- Independent creative work done without a club (coding projects, writing, art)
- Self-directed learning with proof (online courses completed, certifications earned, skills applied in a real context)
- Work experience, including part-time or seasonal jobs

**Reframe depth over breadth.** Two or three activities you’ve committed to deeply and can document specifically are worth more than eight vague entries. An admissions reader would rather see one activity with progression, scale, and outcome than five that say “participated.”

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| You have 4 solid activities | Use remaining slots for a school subject you’ve excelled in (if notable), family responsibilities, or a documented independent project |
| You have 3 or fewer | Add honest context in the Additional Information section — briefly explain circumstances (work obligations, caregiving, school change). Readers know not every student has 10 polished clubs. |
| You’re still in 10th–11th grade | Start one focused activity now. Three months of real participation is worth adding. Choose something tied to your existing profile. |
| You have activities but no outcomes yet | Document starting today. Track hours, people, decisions, and outputs weekly. You’ll have real numbers within a semester. |

**The honest rule:** Don’t add activities you didn’t do. Padding is detectable — readers ask follow-up questions, and inconsistency with your essays is a red flag. A focused list of 4–5 well-described activities is a strong application.
