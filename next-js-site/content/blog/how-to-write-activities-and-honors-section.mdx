Admissions readers don’t “deep read” your activities list. They scan it.

That’s why vague entries (“helped,” “assisted,” “participated”) quietly weaken strong students. The reader can’t tell what you actually did, how serious it was, or what changed because you showed up.

This guide gives you a repeatable formula for writing activities and honors entries that feel specific, measurable, and credible — plus a copy/paste bullet bank.

## What the activities section is really for

Your activities list should make a reader quickly understand:

- **What you chose to do** (and why it fits you)
- **How you contributed** (responsibility and ownership)
- **What changed** (outcomes, scale, proof)
- **Growth over time** (progression, leadership, specialization)

It’s less about “listing everything” and more about showing a coherent pattern.

## The bullet formula that works

When you’re stuck, use this structure:

**Action verb + what you did + how you did it + scope + outcome.**

Examples:

- “Led weekly tutoring block; designed 6-week curriculum; served 28 students; improved quiz averages by 12%.”
- “Built volunteer scheduling system; reduced no-shows 30%; trained 9 new volunteers.”

If you can’t add scope or outcome yet, that’s not a writing problem — it’s a documentation problem. Start tracking now.

## How to quantify without exaggerating

Good quantification is simple and honest:

- People served / participants
- Frequency (weekly, monthly)
- Duration (months/years)
- Output (projects shipped, articles published, events run)
- Growth (before → after)

Avoid fuzzy numbers. Small, accurate metrics beat inflated claims.

## Examples by activity type

### Leadership (clubs / orgs)
Strong:
“Recruited and trained 14 volunteers; launched 3 outreach events; grew attendance 18→52.”

Weak:
“VP — helped run meetings.”

### Research / academic work
Strong:
“Coded data-cleaning pipeline (Python); analyzed 3,200 samples; co-authored poster presented at regional symposium.”

### Work / family responsibilities
Strong:
“Managed weekend shifts; trained 5 new staff; handled inventory; reduced restock errors by 20%.”

### Sports / arts
Strong:
“Captain; led 2x/week drills; mentored 6 underclassmen; team improved league placement (8th→3rd).”

## The honors section: what to include

Honors should be:

- **Accurate** (name + level)
- **Legible** (what it is, if not obvious)
- **Contextual** (school, regional, national)

Examples:

- “National Merit Commended Student (national)”
- “State Science Fair — 2nd place (state)”
- “AP Scholar with Distinction (national)”

If an award name is niche, add one clarifying word.

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Mistake: writing job descriptions.**  
  **Fix**: write outcomes. What changed because you did the job?

- **Mistake: repeating the same verb (“helped”).**  
  **Fix**: use specific verbs tied to ownership (built, led, launched, designed).

- **Mistake: listing too many low-impact activities.**  
  **Fix**: prioritize depth and proof; cut redundancy.
