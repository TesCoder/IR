If you have ever wondered what a former admissions officer looks for in the first 60 seconds of your essay, this walkthrough is for you. The job is to decide quickly whether your voice and choices match the prompt and add something new to the class profile—not to hunt for flashy vocabulary.

By the end, you’ll have:

- A quick mental model for how AOs screen essays in under a minute
- A “spine + receipts” workflow to choose the right story and prove it
- A simple outline and a 60-second self-check before you submit

## How AOs read your essay (fast)
- Prompt alignment first: Does the opening sentence respond to the question and hint at the through-line?
- Proof of impact: Are there clear actions, stakes, and outcomes—not just reflections?
- Fit signals: Do your choices connect to how you will show up on campus (curiosity, community, follow-through)?
- Clarity: Can an AO paraphrase your main idea after the first paragraph?

## Choose a spine before you draft
1) Define the promise: Rewrite the prompt in your own words and state the one change or belief you want the reader to take away.  
2) Pick three receipts: List specific moments (date/time/people) that prove the promise. Drop any story that does not add new evidence.  
3) Name the stakes: Why did this moment matter to you or to others? What changed because you acted?  
4) Tie to campus: Note one habit or value from the story that you will bring to a club, class, or lab.

### Mini example: a strong spine (condensed)
*(Fictional example — just to show structure.)*

- **Promise**: I learned to build systems that make support reliable—not heroic.
- **Receipt #1**: Noticed classmates stopped coming to tutoring; interviewed 6 students to find the friction points.
- **Receipt #2**: Built 12 “micro-lessons” (1 concept + 3 drills) and trained 4 peer tutors; tracked the most-missed skills weekly.
- **Receipt #3**: Attendance rose from ~3/session to 11/session in a month; average quiz scores in the target unit improved by 16 points.
- **Campus tie**: I’ll bring that “make it repeatable” habit to study groups, labs, and student org operations.

## Outline that shows growth (not perfection)
- Hook: A concrete moment that drops us into motion (sound, smell, or quote) and links back to the prompt.
- Context: One sentence on why this problem existed or why you cared.
- Decision point: What you chose to do and what you risked by doing it.
- Turning detail: A small, verifiable detail that only you could supply (date, teammate name, specific metric).
- Reflection: What changed in how you think or act now—and where that shows up on campus.

## Draft with receipts, not generalities
- Swap adjectives for actions: “led a tutoring pilot for 12 ninth-graders, tracked weekly quizzes” beats “helped freshmen.”
- Show constraint: Mention time pressure, limited resources, or competing priorities to prove judgment.
- Use numbers sparingly: 2–3 metrics are enough to anchor the story without reading like a résumé.
- Keep sentences talkable: If you cannot read it aloud without stumbling, tighten it.

## Before you submit: 60-second checklist
- Does the first paragraph answer the prompt and hint at the payoff?
- Are there at least two concrete actions with outcomes?
- Did you name what you learned and how you will use it on campus?
- Is every sentence in your own voice—no generic filler, no thesaurus swaps?
- Final read aloud: If a friend paraphrases your essay after listening, do they get the same takeaway?
