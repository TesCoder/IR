Ivy League supplements are rarely hard because the prompts are confusing.

They’re hard because the bar for specificity is higher. A generic “fit” essay that might pass at another school usually fails in Ivy+ pools because it doesn’t prove:

- deep academic intention,
- real community contribution,
- and a credible match between the two.

This guide breaks Ivy+ prompts into patterns and gives you reusable structures that still feel customized.

## The 3 Ivy+ prompt families you’ll see again and again

### 1) Why Us / Why this school
The job: show you have a plan and you understand what you’ll do there.

Structure:

1. Fit thesis (what you want to explore + environment you want)
2. 2–3 academic specifics (classes, labs, programs) with “so what”
3. 1 community specific (how you’ll participate)
4. Contribution + close

### 2) Community / contribution
The job: show how you affect environments — not just how you “value diversity.”

Structure:

1. Context: where you’ve contributed
2. Action: what you did (ownership)
3. Outcome: what changed (proof)
4. Transfer: how you’ll contribute on campus

### 3) Intellectual curiosity / academic interest
The job: prove you pursue ideas beyond requirements.

Structure:

1. Question or obsession (specific)
2. Exploration (what you did)
3. Insight (what changed your thinking)
4. Next step at this school (fit)

## Safe reuse rules (non-negotiable)

Reuse is fine when you reuse:

- your structure
- your proof points

But you must replace:

- school-specific details
- fit thesis
- community specifics

If your draft could be submitted to another school unchanged, it’s not specific enough.

## Ivy+ “fit” is not name-dropping

Name-dropping looks like:

- long lists of programs
- Wikipedia facts
- phrases like “world-class faculty”

Real fit looks like:

- one class you genuinely want to take and why
- one research group or pathway that matches your prior work
- one community you’ll join and what you’ll bring to it

Fewer details, explained well, wins.
