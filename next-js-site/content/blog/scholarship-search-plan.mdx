Most scholarship searches fail because they’re unstructured. Use a short, repeatable sprint with a clear priority filter, templates, and a tracker you update weekly.

## How to prioritize scholarships (impact vs time)
- Favor local, niche, and affinity awards over national lotteries.
- Score each option on ROI: amount vs time, eligibility fit, renewability, and recommender needs.
- Skip anything that doesn’t match your profile or requires brand-new materials for low payout.

## Weekly search & apply schedule (3 hours/week)
- **Hour 1:** Source 5–8 high-ROI scholarships (local foundations, employers, civic orgs, departmental awards, identity/interest groups). Use national databases only as a supplement.
- **Hours 2–3:** Apply to 2–3, reuse core essays, request any needed recommendations, and log status changes.
- Weekly finish line: two quality submissions and tracker updated.

## Templates: award-specific opener + sponsor follow-up
- Essay opener (adapt): “After [role/impact], I saw [community/need]. This award lets me do [specific next step] and continue [impact].”
- Sponsor follow-up (post-submit):  
  “Hello [Name], I recently applied to [Scholarship] and wanted to thank you for the opportunity. I’m especially excited about [specific focus of scholarship]; happy to share any additional materials if helpful.”

## Tracking columns (copy/paste)

| Scholarship | Amount | Deadline | Eligibility | Essay/Topic | Materials | Status | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Suggested statuses: Not started / In progress / Submitted / Awarded / Declined
