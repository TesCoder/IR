Most scholarship searches fail for one reason: they’re unstructured.

Families search randomly, apply to anything that appears, and burn out after a few weekends — often for scholarships with terrible odds or unclear requirements.

The fix is a sprint: **a short, focused scholarship plan with weekly quotas, a tracker, and a filter for ROI.**

## The scholarship strategy that works (in 3 rules)

1. **Prioritize local and niche scholarships** (better odds than national lotteries)
2. **Apply consistently** (small weekly cadence beats occasional marathons)
3. **Track everything** (deadlines, requirements, status)

## Where to look (high-ROI sources)

Start with:

- High school counseling office + local community foundations
- Employers (parent/guardian and student jobs)
- Civic orgs (Rotary, Kiwanis, local associations)
- Colleges themselves (departmental/honors scholarships)
- Identity/interest-based organizations (STEM, arts, service, cultural groups)

National databases can help, but they’re often noisy. Use them as a supplement, not the core.

## A realistic 6–8 week sprint plan

### Week 1: Setup
- Build your tracker
- Gather reusable materials (resume, transcript, activity list)
- Draft 2 short “core essays” you can adapt

### Weeks 2–7: Weekly cadence
- Identify 5–10 opportunities
- Apply to 2–4 (based on ROI)
- Log outcomes and refine your filter

### Week 8: Clean-up + follow-ups
- Submit remaining high-ROI applications
- Follow up on recommendation requests
- Archive results for next cycle

## The ROI filter (don’t waste time)

Before you apply, ask:

- How competitive is this scholarship (local vs national)?
- How much time will the application take?
- Do I truly meet the requirements?
- Is the award renewable (one-time vs multi-year)?

You want fewer applications with higher odds — not 30 low-quality submissions.
