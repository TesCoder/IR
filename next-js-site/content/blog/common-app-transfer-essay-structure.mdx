Transfer essays have to justify a move without sounding defensive. Use this structure to show direction, fit, and readiness in a concise way.

## The 3-part Transfer Essay Framework

### Part A: Hook + pivot
- In 1–2 sentences, show what changed or what you need next.
- Example lines:
  - “After two semesters in [major/program], I realized I need [specific resource/opportunity].”
  - “A research project on [topic] made it clear I need deeper [lab/course/community] support.”

### Part B: Academic story & evidence
- Add proof you are already doing the work: courses, projects, research, mentors, outcomes.
- Example line:
  - “In [course/project], I built ___; it confirmed I want to specialize in ___ and pursue [next step].”

### Part C: Why this school now (fit + contribution)
- List 2–3 specifics (programs, labs, professors, communities) and how you will use them, plus what you will contribute.
- Example lines:
  - “At [school], I plan to join [program/lab] with [professor] to deepen ___.”
  - “Because of [resource], I can contribute ___ to [club/research/community].”

## Mini outline you can reuse
1) Start: “After two semesters in [major/program], I realized I needed [specific resource/opportunity].”
2) Evidence: “[Course/project] showed me I can ___; I want to deepen that with ___.”
3) Limit at current school: “My current program lacks ___ / has limited ___.”
4) Why this school: “Because [program/faculty/resource], I can ___ and contribute ___.”
5) Close: “By moving now, I’ll be ready to ____ and add ____ to the community.”

## Common mistakes (and fixes)
- Complaint tone.  
  Fix: keep limits factual and brief; emphasize goals and fit.
- Generic fit.  
  Fix: name 2–3 resources and how you’ll use them.
- No trajectory.  
  Fix: add proof points and a forward plan (what you will do with the new resources).
