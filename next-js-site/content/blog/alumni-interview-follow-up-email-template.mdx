If you just finished an alumni or school interview, use this template within 24 hours.

## Quick diagnostic: what a good follow-up must do

A good follow-up email is short.

It does three things:

1. Says thank you
2. Mentions one specific detail you appreciated
3. Reinforces interest (without sounding needy or repetitive)

Send it within **24 hours**.

## Template

Subject: Thank you — [Your Name]

Hi [Interviewer Name],

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciated hearing about [specific detail from the conversation].

Our conversation reinforced my interest in [School], especially because of [one short fit reason tied to your goals].

Thank you again,  
[Your Name]

### Optional: add a brief update (only if meaningful)

If you have a real update (award, new leadership role, completed project), add one sentence:

“As a quick update, I recently [specific update in one line].”

Keep it simple. Don’t attach extra documents unless requested.

## What makes a follow-up email effective?

Four elements separate a follow-up that helps your file from one that reads as filler.

**1. Specificity — references a real moment from the conversation**

| | Example |
|---|---|
| Before (vague) | "I really enjoyed our conversation." |
| After (specific) | "I appreciated hearing about your path from Fuqua into product management — it helped me see how Duke's career network works in practice." |

**2. Fit signal — connects to your actual goals**

| | Example |
|---|---|
| Before (generic) | "I'm very excited about Duke." |
| After (targeted) | "Our conversation reinforced why Duke's policy school is my first choice — especially after hearing how the Bass Connections program lets undergrads lead semester-long projects." |

**3. Brevity — three to five sentences, no attachments**

Admissions alumni interviews are volunteer time. A long email signals you don't understand professional norms. The template above clocks in under 70 words — keep yours in that range.

**4. Timing — within 24 hours, ideally that evening**

Interviewers submit feedback shortly after they meet you. A prompt thank-you reinforces the impression you made; one that arrives four days later doesn't.

## Taylor's follow-up: a filled-in example

Taylor just finished a Duke alumni interview over Zoom. The alumna, Dr. Keisha Owens, works in public health in Atlanta. During the interview, Taylor mentioned a community health research project and Dr. Owens shared how Bass Connections gave her a similar foundation as an undergrad.

That evening, Taylor sent:

---

Subject: Thank you — Taylor Nguyen

Hi Dr. Owens,

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me this evening. I really appreciated hearing about how Bass Connections shaped your path into public health research — it helped me see exactly how Duke's undergraduate experience could connect to the kind of work I want to do.

Our conversation reinforced my interest in Duke, especially because of how the program integrates research with real community impact from the start.

Thank you again,  
Taylor Nguyen

What makes this work: The subject line includes Taylor's name so it's easy to find in the interviewer's inbox. The specific reference (Bass Connections, public health) shows Taylor listened — not just talked. The fit reason is personal and grounded, not just "Duke is great." Total: 74 words.

## Which template variant do you need?

| Your situation | Which template applies | What to adjust |
|---|---|---|
| Standard thank-you — interview went well, nothing to add | Base template above | Fill in [specific detail] and [fit reason]; send as-is |
| You made an error or misspoke — want to correct the record | Base template + one correction sentence | After the fit reason, add: "I also want to briefly clarify — I misstated [X]; the correct detail is [Y]." Keep it factual, one sentence only. |
| You want to add a meaningful update — new award, new role | Base template + the optional update sentence | Use the "optional update" sentence: "As a quick update, I recently [specific update]." Place it before the closing thank-you. Only include if the update happened after your interview date. |
| The interviewer gave you advice or a recommendation | Base template + brief acknowledgment | After the fit reason, add one sentence: "I also wanted to say — your suggestion about [specific advice] was genuinely helpful, and I plan to [action]." |

Hard rule: choose **one** variant. Don't stack a correction and an update in the same email.

## What if the interviewer gave you their personal email?

Some alumni give students their personal Gmail or work email during the interview. It's fine to use it — follow up at the same address they used to schedule the interview, or the one they offered during the call. Don't track down a different address just to use their "official" school email.

Two things to watch:

- **If they gave you a personal email explicitly**, use it. This is how they want to hear from you.
- **If their institutional email auto-populated through the admissions portal**, reply to that unless they specified otherwise.

Don't overthink it. The interviewer volunteered for this role. A polite thank-you to either address won't hurt you.
