## Quick diagnostic: what a good follow-up must do

A good follow-up email is short.

It does three things:

1. Says thank you
2. Mentions one specific detail you appreciated
3. Reinforces interest (without sounding needy or repetitive)

Send it within **24 hours**.

## Template

Subject: Thank you — [Your Name]

Hi [Interviewer Name],

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciated hearing about [specific detail from the conversation].

Our conversation reinforced my interest in [School], especially because of [one short fit reason tied to your goals].

Thank you again,  
[Your Name]

### Optional: add a brief update (only if meaningful)

If you have a real update (award, new leadership role, completed project), add one sentence:

“As a quick update, I recently [specific update in one line].”

Keep it simple. Don’t attach extra documents unless requested.
