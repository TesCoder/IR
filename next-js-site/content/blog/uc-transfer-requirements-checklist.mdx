UC transfer planning is a calendar game.

Most transfer mistakes aren’t about “not being strong enough.” They’re about missing a requirement, misunderstanding major prep, or assuming one campus’s rules apply to all.

This guide gives you a practical UC transfer checklist and a simple milestone approach.

Note: UC policies vary by campus and major and can change. Always confirm requirements for your specific campus/major.

## The three buckets to track

### 1) Units and course planning
Transfer planning requires you to track:

- total units completed (and what counts)
- full-time vs part-time timing
- sequencing (some prerequisites must be taken in order)

### 2) Major preparation
For competitive majors, major prep is often the gate.

Your priority is usually:

- required prerequisite courses
- minimum grades in specific courses
- recommended courses that strengthen your preparation

### 3) GPA strategy
For many majors, small GPA changes can shift outcomes. That means:

- knowing where your GPA stands
- protecting performance in prerequisite sequences
- avoiding schedule overload that harms grades

## A practical milestone plan

### 12–18 months out
- Choose target campuses/majors
- Confirm major prep requirements and course sequencing
- Build a term-by-term course plan

### 6–12 months out
- Confirm you’re on track for required units and prerequisites
- Check deadlines and application requirements
- Start building your story: why transfer, fit, readiness

### 2–6 months out
- Finalize transcripts and reporting
- Draft essays (if required) and application descriptions
- Confirm any additional campus-specific steps
