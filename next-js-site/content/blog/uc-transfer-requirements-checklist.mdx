Transferring to a University of California school has clear requirements — but they can be easy to miss. This checklist walks you through required coursework, minimum GPA expectations, application windows, and the documents to prepare so your transfer application is complete and competitive.

UC policies vary by campus and major and can change. Always confirm requirements for your specific campus/major before you submit.

## Who Should Use This Checklist
- California community college transfers mapping UC pathways.
- Students pursuing ADT or IGETC who need a campus-by-campus double-check.
- International or out-of-state transfers aligning major prep with UC expectations.

## Minimum GPA & Course Requirements (campus variations)
- Check the GPA and course thresholds for your exact campus/major (ASSIST.org and campus pages).
- Prioritize required major prep first; competitive majors often need higher-than-listed GPAs.
- Protect sequences (e.g., calculus, lab sciences) and avoid overloads that risk grades.

## General Education / ADT / IGETC Notes
- Confirm if your target campus accepts full IGETC or ADT for your major; some majors exclude certain IGETC areas.
- Track any missing GE areas early so you are not scrambling in the final term.
- If you waive IGETC/ADT, document why and confirm alternatives with campus guidance.

## Application windows & Important Deadlines
- Start 12–18 months out: select campuses/majors and map prerequisites by term.
- Mark UC application windows and supplemental deadlines for each campus; include TAG if applicable.
- Plan transcript ordering and recommendation/document requests with buffers (3–4 weeks).

## Documents & Transcripts Checklist
- Official transcripts from all colleges attended — request early (allow 3–4 weeks).
- Verified course lists and prerequisites (with grades/in-progress).
- Proof of GE pattern (IGETC/ADT) if applicable.
- Course descriptions/syllabi for any non-CCC coursework that may need evaluation.
- Financial and residency documents if requested by specific campuses.

## How IvyReady Helps (short CTA rail)
- Former admissions officers can sanity-check your campus/major plan, confirm GPA/course readiness, and spot missing documents before you file.
- Need a transfer strategy? Book a short review with a former admissions officer to confirm your checklist — no guesswork.
