Transferring to a University of California school has clear requirements — but they can be easy to miss. This checklist walks you through required coursework, minimum GPA expectations, application windows, and the documents to prepare so your transfer application is complete and competitive.

UC policies vary by campus and major and can change. Always confirm requirements for your specific campus/major before you submit.

## Who should use this checklist
- California community college transfers mapping UC pathways.
- Students pursuing ADT or IGETC who need a campus-by-campus double-check.
- International or out-of-state transfers aligning major prep with UC expectations.

## Which UC campus path applies to you?

Your GPA, major, and community college determine which campuses are realistic. Use this table to prioritize where to invest preparation effort before mapping prerequisites.

| Campus group | Competitive GPA target | Key requirements | Strategic note |
|---|---|---|---|
| UC Berkeley / UCLA — high-competition majors (CS, Biology, Business, Economics) | 3.7–4.0+ overall; 3.8+ in major prep courses | Major-specific prerequisites (Calculus I–II, lab science sequences, Chemistry series); TAG not available for Berkeley or UCLA | Treat listed prerequisites as the minimum floor. Review ASSIST.org for your exact major — one missing series course can make you ineligible. |
| UC San Diego / UC Davis | 3.5–3.8 (major-dependent) | IGETC or ADT + full major prep (lab sciences, Calculus for STEM); some majors are separately impacted | A strong lab or research background differentiates STEM applicants. Confirm impaction status on the campus page before applying — some majors publish a separate competitive GPA range. |
| UC Santa Cruz / UC Riverside | 3.2–3.5 | IGETC accepted; major prep courses recommended, though thresholds are lower for most non-impacted programs | More accessible GPA range overall — but impacted majors (CS, Nursing) still carry stricter criteria. |
| TAG-eligible campuses (Davis, Irvine, Merced, Riverside, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz) | 3.2–3.4 (varies by campus and major) | TAG GPA threshold must be met by end of spring term; TAG agreement locks a conditional offer at one campus | File TAG in October alongside your UC application. One campus per student per cycle. UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego are not TAG-eligible. |

## Minimum GPA & course requirements (campus variations)
- Check the GPA and course thresholds for your exact campus/major (ASSIST.org and campus pages).
- Prioritize required major prep first; competitive majors often need higher-than-listed GPAs.
- Protect sequences (e.g., calculus, lab sciences) and avoid overloads that risk grades.

## General education / ADT / IGETC notes
- Confirm if your target campus accepts full IGETC or ADT for your major; some majors exclude certain IGETC areas.
- Track any missing GE areas early so you are not scrambling in the final term.
- If you waive IGETC/ADT, document why and confirm alternatives with campus guidance.

## Application windows & important deadlines
- Start 12–18 months out: select campuses/majors and map prerequisites by term.
- Mark UC application windows and supplemental deadlines for each campus; include TAG if applicable.
- Plan transcript ordering and recommendation/document requests with buffers (3–4 weeks).

## Documents & transcripts checklist
- Official transcripts from all colleges attended — request early (allow 3–4 weeks).
- Verified course lists and prerequisites (with grades/in-progress).
- Proof of GE pattern (IGETC/ADT) if applicable.
- Course descriptions/syllabi for any non-CCC coursework that may need evaluation.
- Financial and residency documents if requested by specific campuses.

## Keiko's checklist walkthrough: De Anza to 5 UC campuses, pre-med Biology

Keiko is a first-year student at De Anza College applying in fall 2025 to five UC campuses — Berkeley, Davis, San Diego, Santa Cruz, and Riverside — as a pre-med Biology transfer. Here is how she applied each section of this checklist.

**Step 1 — Campus/major map (12 months out, October 2024):** Keiko opened ASSIST.org for all five campuses and listed every required course for Biology transfer. She found that UC Berkeley Biology requires two semesters of introductory Biology (Cell & Molecular + Genetics/Evolution), while UC Davis requires only one plus a lab. She added BIO 11 (Genetics) to her spring schedule to avoid being ineligible at Berkeley.

**Step 2 — GPA and course sequencing:** Her fall GPA was 3.6. To remain competitive at UC Berkeley (target 3.8+) she needed an A in General Chemistry I. To lock the UC Davis TAG she needed to maintain ≥3.2 overall. She built her spring schedule to protect both targets — no overload beyond 14 units, protecting her Chemistry and Biology grades above all else.

**Step 3 — TAG filing (October 2024):** Keiko filed a TAG agreement with UC Davis, securing a conditional offer for fall 2026 admission as long as she finishes with ≥3.2 GPA and completes her required coursework. This removed Davis from the "uncertain" column and let her treat the remaining four campuses as reach and match applications.

**Step 4 — Documents (September 2024 request):** She requested De Anza official transcripts four weeks before the UC application window opened. She also confirmed her IGETC plan with her counselor — all seven areas completed or in-progress by June 2025. She kept copies of syllabi for her lab courses in case any campus requested course descriptions.

**Outcome:** By walking campus-by-campus through the checklist on ASSIST.org, Keiko caught one missing prerequisite (Berkeley's second Bio semester) with enough time to add it. The TAG filing guaranteed one strong offer while she applied competitively to four others.

## What if you're applying to a high-impaction major like Computer Science or Nursing?

Some UC majors are classified as "impacted" — demand exceeds available spots, and admission criteria are stricter than the general transfer threshold listed on ASSIST.org. If your intended major appears on a campus's impacted major page, the rules change.

**Computer Science (UC San Diego, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara):**
- Published minimum GPA is typically 3.2–3.5, but competitive admits average 3.6–3.8+ at most campuses.
- Coursework requirements usually include Calculus I–II, Discrete Math, and at least one (sometimes two) programming courses — check each campus's impacted major page, not only ASSIST.org.
- Some campuses publish a separate "competitive GPA range" on their CS transfer page that does not appear in the general ASSIST articulation agreement.

**Nursing (UC Davis, UC Irvine):**
- Clinical nursing programs (e.g., UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing CANR pathway, UC Irvine BSN) use cohort-based admission processes separate from the main UC transfer application.
- Required science prerequisites typically include Anatomy & Physiology I–II, Microbiology, General Chemistry, and Statistics — often each requiring a C+ or better with no grade forgiveness.
- Application timelines and deadlines may differ from the standard November UC window. Confirm directly with the nursing school admissions office.

**Decision rule:** If your intended major appears on a campus's impacted major list, treat the listed minimum GPA as a floor, not a target. Build your plan around the published competitive GPA range. Declare a non-impacted backup major on your UC application so you remain eligible for review if the impacted major is not offered admission.
