This post covers what to do after receiving a waitlist decision — whether to stay on the list, how to write a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI), what to expect from financial aid, and how to protect your options while you wait. It does not cover how to strengthen your application before decisions come out — for that, see [How to Appeal a Financial Aid Offer](/blog/how-to-appeal-financial-aid-offer) for post-decision aid strategy, or [Supplemental Essays Strategy](/blog/supplemental-essays-strategy) for pre-application work.

## <span id="what-it-means">What a waitlist decision actually means</span>

A waitlist is not a soft rejection, and it is not a near-admission. It is a yield management tool. Schools waitlist more students than they expect to admit because they cannot predict exactly how many admitted students will deposit.

If their enrolled class comes in below their enrollment target after the May 1 deposit deadline, they activate the waitlist. If yield is strong, the waitlist stays closed all year.

A few facts worth knowing before you decide anything:

- **Typical admission rate from the waitlist: 0–30%**, and the range is wide. Some years a school admits hundreds of waitlisted students. Other years, none.
- **Most waitlist movement happens between early May and late June** — after the May 1 deadline, once schools can count deposits.
- **You have no obligation to stay on the waitlist.** Declining is a completely valid choice.
- **The Common Data Set (Section C2) for each school** shows how many waitlisted students were offered admission and how many enrolled in previous years. That number is publicly available and worth looking up.

The honest baseline: for most students at most schools, the waitlist does not convert to admission. That does not mean you should automatically decline — it means you should make an informed decision.

## <span id="should-you-stay">Should you stay on the waitlist?</span>

Run through this table before you decide.

| Question | If yes → | If no → |
|---|---|---|
| Is this school your true first choice? | Staying makes sense | Consider declining — emotional cost may not be worth low odds |
| Do you have an acceptable enrolled school? | Staying is lower-risk | Staying is higher-stakes — your fallback matters more |
| Can you receive financial aid from the waitlist? | Check before confirming | Assume aid will be limited or unavailable |
| Is the school historically active (admits >5% from the WL)? | Probability of movement is higher | Lower probability — adjust expectations accordingly |

If you decide to stay: **confirm your spot within 48 hours** by emailing admissions or using the school's portal. Read their instructions carefully — some schools require an active confirmation, and if you don't submit it, you may be automatically removed from the list.

If you decide to decline: do it promptly. It frees your spot for another applicant and lets you move forward cleanly.

## <span id="first-48-hours">Your first 48 hours</span>

Move through these steps in order. The timeline matters.

1. **Confirm your place on the waitlist.** Find the school's specific instructions — email or portal — and submit your confirmation. Don't assume you're on it until you've actively confirmed.

2. **Deposit at your best current option by May 1.** This is non-negotiable. You cannot rely on a waitlist outcome. Protect yourself with a real enrolled school.

3. **Check whether the school has additional materials requirements.** Some schools invite waitlisted students to submit updated grades, a new short essay, or a recent activity update. Others explicitly say no additional materials. Follow their instructions.

4. **Look up historical waitlist yield for this school.** Check the Common Data Set (Section C2), Naviance if your school has it, or College Confidential threads for recent years. You want to know whether this school typically moves its waitlist at all — and if so, roughly how many students it admits.

5. **Start drafting your LOCI — but don't send it the same day.** A LOCI sent the morning of your waitlist notification reads as reactive. Give yourself 3–5 days to write something specific and composed.

## <span id="how-to-write-loci">How to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest)</span>

A LOCI is a brief, professional letter to the admissions office confirming that you still want to attend and giving them one or two concrete updates since you applied. It is not a second personal statement. It is not a chance to re-argue your application.

**Key parameters:**

- **Length:** 200–350 words. If it's longer, cut it.
- **Format:** Email or uploaded document, depending on the school's instructions. Check before sending.
- **Tone:** Confident and specific. Not desperate, not effusive.
- **Send timing:** 3–10 days after receiving your waitlist notification. Not the same day.

**What a LOCI must include:**

1. A clear statement that this school is your first choice and you will enroll if admitted
2. One or two genuine updates since you applied — a grade milestone, award, project completion, new leadership role
3. One or two specific things about the school that still make it the right fit for your goals
4. Nothing else — no restatement of your whole application, no new essays

**What to leave out:** apologies for taking their time, statements like "I know you receive many letters like this," anything that sounds like you're asking them to reconsider rather than simply updating them.

**LOCI Template**

```
Subject: Letter of Continued Interest — [Your Name], Class of [Year]

Dear [Admissions Office / specific name if known],

I want to reaffirm that [School Name] remains my first choice, and I would
enroll immediately if offered a place from the waitlist.

Since submitting my application, I [specific update: e.g., "completed my
capstone project on X and received recognition from Y," or "was elected
captain of my varsity team," or "earned a 4.0 in my most recent semester"].
[1–2 sentences about why this update is meaningful and connects to your
goals at this school.]

[School Name]'s [specific program, professor, research center, or campus
initiative] remains central to what I want to do in college. [1 sentence
on why specifically — not generic.]

I remain committed to this school and would be grateful for the opportunity
to attend. Thank you for keeping me under consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Email] | [Phone]
[Application ID if known]
```

Use the school's actual program name, not a department category. "The Computational Linguistics Lab and its work on low-resource language modeling" is specific. "Your great computer science program" is not.

If you have a significant relationship with a specific admissions officer or an alumni interviewer who went to bat for you, address the letter to that person and CC the general admissions office.

## <span id="financial-aid">Financial aid on the waitlist</span>

This is the part most students don't ask about until it's too late.

**The baseline reality:** most schools that admit students from the waitlist offer reduced financial aid — or none at all. By the time waitlist movement happens in May and June, the school's aid budget is largely committed to the students who deposited on May 1.

Before you confirm your spot on the waitlist, email the financial aid office directly and ask: *"What financial aid can I expect if I'm admitted from the waitlist?"* Some schools will give you a straight answer. Others will say it varies. Either way, you'll know more than if you didn't ask.

A few things to understand:

- **Merit aid from the waitlist is rare.** Most merit scholarships are awarded in the initial round. Don't assume a waitlist admission comes with the same package you might have received as a regular admit.
- **Need-based aid from the waitlist may be partial.** If the school meets full need for initially admitted students, they may not be able to guarantee the same for waitlisted admits.
- **If the school can't match your enrolled school's financial aid package**, that's a real factor in whether staying on the waitlist is the right call — especially if you're still paying a deposit at your enrolled school while you wait.

The waitlist is not a financial aid strategy. If cost is a deciding factor between two schools, resolve it through the financial aid appeal process at your enrolled school rather than banking on a waitlist outcome.

## <span id="protecting-yourself">Protecting yourself while you wait</span>

The waitlist period runs from late April through late June for most schools. That's two months of uncertainty. Here's how to manage it without putting yourself at risk.

**What you must do:**

- **Deposit at your best current option by May 1.** If you miss the deposit deadline at your enrolled school while waiting on the waitlist, you may lose your spot entirely. Do not gamble on this.
- **Stay engaged with your enrolled school.** Register for orientation, submit your housing deposit if required, complete any enrollment paperwork. Treat it as your school — because it is, unless something changes.
- **Know the response window.** If you are admitted from the waitlist, most schools give you 24–72 hours to respond. Know this timeline in advance so you're not caught off guard.

**What not to do:**

- **Do not ask your enrolled school to defer your deposit** while you wait on a waitlist decision. Most schools won't agree to it, and you risk losing your spot at your enrolled school with no guarantee of anything from the waitlist.
- **Do not deposit at two schools simultaneously** in the hope that one works out. This violates the enrollment agreement you sign with both schools and can result in admission being rescinded.

**If you are admitted from the waitlist:**

- Notify your enrolled school immediately. You will likely forfeit your enrollment deposit — factor that into your decision when it happens.
- Request financial aid information in writing before you accept.
- Confirm your waitlist admission in writing and get a financial aid offer before withdrawing from your enrolled school.

## <span id="scenario">Marcus's waitlist decision</span>

Marcus is waitlisted at his first-choice school in late March. He has also been accepted at the University of Michigan with a partial merit scholarship. Here is how he works through it.

Within 24 hours of receiving the waitlist notification, he logs into the school's portal and confirms his spot. The school requires an active confirmation — missing it would remove him from the list automatically. He does not overthink whether to stay; he commits to the process and moves on to the next step.

By April 28, three days before the national deadline, he deposits at Michigan. He is disappointed, but he understands the logic: not depositing means risking having no school in September. He treats Michigan as his school from that point forward — not a backup, not a placeholder.

Before writing his LOCI, he spends an afternoon on the Common Data Set. Section C2 shows the school offered admission to roughly 3% of its waitlisted applicants the prior year. That is a long shot, but not zero. He writes the LOCI anyway: 270 words reaffirming the school as his first choice, noting a GPA improvement from 3.7 to 3.9 in his final semester, and referencing a specific research lab that connects directly to his intended major. He does not ask them to reconsider. He updates and reaffirms.

June comes and the list does not move. Marcus has already attended Michigan's admitted student events, submitted housing preferences, and mentally enrolled. When the form letter arrives confirming the waitlist is closed, he is disappointed but not derailed. He had protected himself first and written the LOCI anyway — which is exactly the right order of operations.

## <span id="edge-cases">Edge cases</span>

A few situations that come up less often but matter if they apply to you.

**"I was waitlisted at all my schools."** Rare, but it happens. Confirm your spot on every waitlist. Then look up each school's historical waitlist movement using the Common Data Set (Section C2) and prioritize the one with the highest admit rate from the list. Also check whether you have any schools with rolling admissions that you have not yet applied to — applications in March or April are still possible at many programs, and a strong enrolled option is worth more than a speculative waitlist position.

**"The school told me to submit additional materials."** Do it immediately. Some schools ask for a current transcript, a brief activity update, or a new teacher recommendation after placing students on the waitlist. Not responding when explicitly asked is effectively a soft withdrawal. Read their instructions carefully and submit by whatever deadline they give.

**"My family is pressuring me to skip the deposit and wait."** Do not skip the deposit. Losing a $200–$500 enrollment deposit is painful but recoverable. Having no enrolled school in September is not. The deposit protects your option — it does not commit you to enrolling if a waitlist offer comes through. Protect yourself first, then see what happens.
