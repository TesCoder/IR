UC applications reward clarity and proof.

The Personal Insight Questions (PIQs) are not a “creative writing” contest — they’re short, structured opportunities to show who you are through **actions, outcomes, and reflection**. The activities section works the same way: vague participation reads weak; specific contribution reads strong.

This guide gives you repeatable PIQ structures and examples of strong activities phrasing you can adapt.

## The UC PIQ goal (in one sentence)

Each PIQ should help a reader confidently say:

> “I know what this student did, what they learned, and how they’ll contribute.”

UC readers move fast. Make your answer easy to scan.

## Choosing PIQ prompts: avoid overlap

You typically want PIQs that show **different sides of you**:

- Academic curiosity or problem-solving
- Leadership/initiative
- Community/impact
- Growth through a challenge or responsibility

A common mistake is writing four versions of the same story (all leadership, all service, all “hard work”). Variety helps your application feel dimensional.

## PIQ structures that work (and why)

### Structure A: Context → Action → Result → Reflection (best default)

1. **Context**: what’s the situation? (1–2 sentences)
2. **Action**: what did you do specifically? (most of the space)
3. **Result**: what changed? (numbers help)
4. **Reflection**: what you learned and how it shows up now

This structure prevents “vibes essays” with no proof.

### Structure B: Moment → Decision → Consequence → Forward motion (great for leadership)

1. A concrete moment
2. A decision point
3. What happened because you chose that path
4. How you’ll apply it next (on campus and beyond)

### Structure C: Curiosity → Experiment → Insight (great for academic/intellectual prompts)

1. Question you pursued
2. What you did to explore it (project, research, build, reading + application)
3. What you learned and how it changed your thinking

## What “good PIQ voice” sounds like

UC PIQs usually work best when they sound:

- Direct
- Specific
- Grounded in real choices

Avoid:

- Abstract philosophical openings
- Long backstory paragraphs
- Claiming impact without evidence

## Activities section: phrasing that reads strong

The formula that works:

**Action verb + what you did + scope + outcome.**

Weak:
“Volunteered at hospital, helped patients.”

Stronger:
“Coordinated weekly volunteer schedule; trained 6 new volunteers; reduced shift gaps by 25%.”

Weak:
“President of club, planned meetings.”

Stronger:
“Led 8-person officer team; launched 3 workshops; grew membership 22→61; raised $1,450 for community partner.”

## Verbs that signal ownership (use what you can defend)

- Led, managed, coordinated, trained, mentored
- Built, designed, created, launched, implemented
- Analyzed, researched, synthesized, modeled
- Increased, reduced, improved, streamlined, optimized

## The quickest way to improve a PIQ draft

After you draft, do a “proof pass”:

- Highlight every sentence that shows an action you took.
- Circle every measurable result.
- If you have fewer than 2 actions or 1 result, add proof.

Strong PIQs are not longer — they’re clearer.
