The “Why Major?” essay isn’t asking, “Do you like this subject?”

It’s asking: **Is your interest credible — and do you have a plan for how you’ll explore it on our campus?**

Most weak “Why Major” essays fail because they’re too vague (“I’ve always loved science”) or too résumé-like (a list of classes with no meaning). The strongest essays show a simple arc:

- origin of interest,
- exploration with proof,
- and forward motion with fit.

This guide gives you templates by discipline so your essay sounds specific and believable.

You’ll also get a universal structure, a mini worked example, and common mistakes to avoid—so you can adapt templates without sounding generic.

## What schools want to learn from “Why Major”

Admissions readers are trying to understand:

- **Motivation**: why this subject (not just “it’s interesting”)
- **Evidence**: what have you done to explore it?
- **Readiness**: do you understand what the major actually involves?
- **Fit**: why this campus is a good place for your next step

## The universal structure (works for most majors)

1. **Origin** (a moment or problem that sparked interest)
2. **Exploration** (what you did — classes, projects, reading, research, building)
3. **Evidence** (a concrete outcome, insight, or artifact)
4. **Fit** (2–3 campus specifics connected to your trajectory)
5. **Forward motion** (what you want to do next and how you’ll contribute)

**Mini-example (STEM, compressed):**
- **Origin**: After building a simple sensor project, I kept wondering why its readings drifted in heat, so I started digging into calibration.
- **Exploration**: I tested different designs and wrote a small script to compare error across conditions.
- **Evidence**: The final version reduced average error from ~8% to ~2%, and I documented what changed in a short write-up.
- **Fit**: At [School], I want to extend this in ___ (course/lab/group) because it connects to my next questions about ___.
- **Forward motion**: Next, I want to build ___ (a more ambitious project or research question) and contribute by ___ (project, club, lab support).

That’s what “credible interest” looks like: a specific problem, a process, and a tangible outcome.

## Templates by discipline

Use these templates as scaffolds—don’t copy them verbatim. Replace the blanks with your specific experiences, and keep your natural voice.

### STEM (CS, engineering, math, sciences)
Angle prompts:

- What problem did you try to solve or build?
- What did you test, debug, or iterate?
- What did you learn that changed your approach?

Template:

```text
I became interested in ___ when ___. I explored it by ___ (project/course/research). Through ___, I learned ___. At [School], I want to deepen this by ___ (specific program/lab/course) and contribute by ___.
```

### Business / economics
Angle prompts:

- What system did you analyze (markets, organizations, incentives)?
- What project shows initiative (club, case comp, small venture)?

Template:

```text
My interest in ___ grew from ___. I explored it through ___ and learned ___. At [School], I’m excited by ___ (program/course/club) because ___. I hope to apply this by ___ (project, research, campus contribution).
```

### Humanities / social sciences
Angle prompts:

- What question keeps pulling you back?
- What text, idea, or debate changed how you think?
- How do you connect ideas to real-world impact?

Template:

```text
I’m drawn to ___ because ___. I explored this through ___ and became especially interested in ___. At [School], I want to study this further through ___ and contribute by ___.
```

### Arts / creative majors
Angle prompts:

- What have you made (portfolio proof)?
- How did your craft evolve?
- What kind of creative community do you thrive in?

Template:

```text
I started ___ when ___. Over time, I developed ___ by ___ (projects/performances). At [School], I’m excited by ___ (studios, faculty, ensembles) because ___. I hope to contribute by ___.
```

### Pre-med / health pathways (for supplements, not “I want to help people”)
Angle prompts:

- What experiences built understanding (service, research, clinical exposure)?
- What did you learn about the realities and ethics of health work?

Template:

```text
My interest in health grew from ___. I explored it through ___ and learned ___. At [School], I want to deepen this through ___ and contribute through ___.
```

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Mistake: no proof beyond classes.**  
  **Fix**: add a project, artifact, or independent exploration.

- **Mistake: “I want to help people.”**  
  **Fix**: show a specific health/impact interest and what you’ve learned about it.

- **Mistake: generic campus fit.**  
  **Fix**: connect specifics to your next step (what you’ll do with them).

## Outline your Why Major

If you want help turning your interest into a credible arc (and choosing the best proof points), we can help you outline quickly. In a free consultation, we’ll map your strongest evidence to the 5-part structure and identify 2–3 campus fit details to research—so your draft sounds specific. You’ll leave with an outline you can draft from.
