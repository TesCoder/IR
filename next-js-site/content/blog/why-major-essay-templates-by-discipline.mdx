The “Why Major?” essay isn’t asking, “Do you like this subject?”

It’s asking: **Is your interest credible — and do you have a plan for how you’ll explore it on our campus?**

Most weak “Why Major” essays fail because they’re too vague (“I’ve always loved science”) or too résumé-like (a list of classes with no meaning). The strongest essays show a simple arc:

- origin of interest,
- exploration with proof,
- and forward motion with fit.

This guide gives you templates by discipline so your essay sounds specific and believable.

## What schools want to learn from “Why Major”

Admissions readers are trying to understand:

- **Motivation**: why this subject (not just “it’s interesting”)
- **Evidence**: what have you done to explore it?
- **Readiness**: do you understand what the major actually involves?
- **Fit**: why this campus is a good place for your next step

## The universal structure (works for most majors)

1. **Origin** (a moment or problem that sparked interest)
2. **Exploration** (what you did — classes, projects, reading, research, building)
3. **Evidence** (a concrete outcome, insight, or artifact)
4. **Fit** (2–3 campus specifics connected to your trajectory)
5. **Forward motion** (what you want to do next and how you’ll contribute)

## Templates by discipline

### STEM (CS, engineering, math, sciences)
Angle prompts:

- What problem did you try to solve or build?
- What did you test, debug, or iterate?
- What did you learn that changed your approach?

Template:
“I became interested in ___ when ___. I explored it by ___ (project/course/research). Through ___, I learned ___. At [School], I want to deepen this by ___ (specific program/lab/course) and contribute by ___.”

### Business / economics
Angle prompts:

- What system did you analyze (markets, organizations, incentives)?
- What project shows initiative (club, case comp, small venture)?

Template:
“My interest in ___ grew from ___. I explored it through ___ and learned ___. At [School], I’m excited by ___ (program/course/club) because ___. I hope to apply this by ___ (project, research, campus contribution).”

### Humanities / social sciences
Angle prompts:

- What question keeps pulling you back?
- What text, idea, or debate changed how you think?
- How do you connect ideas to real-world impact?

Template:
“I’m drawn to ___ because ___. I explored this through ___ and became especially interested in ___. At [School], I want to study this further through ___ and contribute by ___.”

### Arts / creative majors
Angle prompts:

- What have you made (portfolio proof)?
- How did your craft evolve?
- What kind of creative community do you thrive in?

Template:
“I started ___ when ___. Over time, I developed ___ by ___ (projects/performances). At [School], I’m excited by ___ (studios, faculty, ensembles) because ___. I hope to contribute by ___.”

### Pre-med / health pathways (for supplements, not “I want to help people”)
Angle prompts:

- What experiences built understanding (service, research, clinical exposure)?
- What did you learn about the realities and ethics of health work?

Template:
“My interest in health grew from ___. I explored it through ___ and learned ___. At [School], I want to deepen this through ___ and contribute through ___.”

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Mistake: no proof beyond classes.**  
  **Fix**: add a project, artifact, or independent exploration.

- **Mistake: “I want to help people.”**  
  **Fix**: show a specific health/impact interest and what you’ve learned about it.

- **Mistake: generic campus fit.**  
  **Fix**: connect specifics to your next step (what you’ll do with them).
