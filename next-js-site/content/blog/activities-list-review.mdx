Your activities list is one of the most compressed parts of your application—and also one of the most powerful.

In this example post, we’ll walk through how admissions officers typically scan activities, what they look for in the first 1–2 seconds, and how you can structure each entry to maximize impact.

## What AOs see in 1–2 seconds
- Role and context (what the activity is and where it sits).
- Impact and scope (who/what changed because of you).
- Results with numbers (participants, dollars, hours, outcomes).
- Time/tenure signals (duration, cadence, promotion).

## Quick checklist for each line
1) Start with the role and who/what you led or built.  
2) Add the action and scale (how often, how many people, dollars, or outputs).  
3) Finish with the outcome or proof (results, score changes, awards, adoption).  
4) If space remains, note duration or promotion to show trajectory.

Here are concise before/after lines that match how AOs scan your list:

### Leadership example
- **Before (weak):** “Club president, ran meetings and organized events.”  
- **After (strong):** “President — led 18-member robotics team; doubled outreach events (4→8) and placed 2nd at regionals.”

### Service/club example
- **Before (weak):** “Volunteer tutor for freshmen math.”  
- **After (strong):** “Peer tutor — built 6-week Algebra I bootcamp; 12 students improved quiz scores 62%→78%; created handouts reused by department.”
