Your activities list is one of the most compressed parts of your application—and also one of the most powerful.

Admissions officers don’t read it like a résumé. They scan it like evidence.

This post gives you the AO's lens: how officers scan your list in 1–2 seconds and what signals they're actually looking for — and what makes most entries read like participation instead of proof. For the step-by-step writing formula, verb bank, and worked examples, see [How to Write the Activities & Honors Section](/blog/how-to-write-activities-and-honors-section).

## What AOs see in 1–2 seconds

Most readers are trying to answer four questions fast:

- **Role + context**: what is this, and what did you own?
- **Scope**: how big was it (people, outputs, frequency, responsibility)?
- **Proof**: what changed because of you (results, adoption, recognition)?
- **Trajectory**: did you grow (promotion, expansion, multi-year commitment)?

If your entry doesn’t show at least 2 of those quickly, it reads like participation.

<span id="checklist"></span>
## Quick checklist for each line
1) Start with the role and who/what you led or built.  
2) Add the action and scale (how often, how many people, dollars, or outputs).  
3) Finish with the outcome or proof (results, score changes, awards, adoption).  
4) If space remains, note duration or promotion to show trajectory.

Keep your entries **defensible**. Don’t invent metrics, “leadership,” or outcomes. You want compression, not exaggeration.

<span id="constraints"></span>
## The constraint: Common App fields + character limits (use every box)

On the Common App, the *description* box is tight (often **150 characters**). The common mistake is trying to cram *everything* there.

Instead, use the fields like a system:

- **Position/Leadership**: put the title that signals ownership (Founder, Captain, Section Leader, Shift Lead).
- **Organization name**: use it for context so your description doesn’t waste characters (e.g., “City Food Pantry,” “School Robotics Team”).
- **Activity type**: helps the reader categorize instantly.
- **Hours/week + weeks/year + grade levels**: these are credibility signals (don’t repeat them in the description).
- **Description (150 chars)**: spend this on **actions + scope + outcomes**.

Rule of thumb: if you repeat the same info in two fields, you’re wasting your most valuable space.

<span id="template"></span>
## A template that works in 150 characters

Write descriptions like compressed proof:

**Action verb + what you did + scope + outcome.**

Helpful verbs (use only what you can defend):
- Led, managed, coordinated, trained, mentored
- Built, designed, launched, implemented
- Researched, analyzed, synthesized, modeled
- Increased, reduced, improved, streamlined

If you don’t have a clean number, use credible scope words: weekly, semester-long, schoolwide, districtwide, bilingual, first-gen, etc.

<span id="examples"></span>
## Before/after examples by activity type

These aren’t “fancy wording” upgrades. They’re **evidence upgrades**.

### Leadership example
- **Before (weak):** “Club president, ran meetings and organized events.”  
- **After (strong):** “President — led 18-member robotics team; doubled outreach events (4→8) and placed 2nd at regionals.”

### Service/club example
- **Before (weak):** “Volunteer tutor for freshmen math.”  
- **After (strong):** “Peer tutor — built 6-week Algebra I bootcamp; 12 students improved quiz scores 62%→78%; created handouts reused by department.”

### Job example (responsibility + trust)
- **Before (weak):** “Worked as a cashier at a grocery store.”  
- **After (strong):** “Cashier — handled ~$2K/day; trained 3 new hires; resolved issues fast; maintained 98% accuracy on nightly close.”

### Research/academic project example (what you actually did)
- **Before (weak):** “Did research with a professor.”  
- **After (strong):** “Research assistant — cleaned 12k-row dataset; ran weekly analyses in Python; wrote summary used in lab meeting.”

### Athletics example (contribution beyond participation)
- **Before (weak):** “Varsity soccer player.”  
- **After (strong):** “Varsity soccer — captain; ran 2x/week film review; organized youth clinic; improved conditioning plan (injuries down).”

### Family responsibility example (real responsibility counts)
- **Before (weak):** “Helped my family a lot at home.”  
- **After (strong):** “Family caregiver — managed sibling pickup/homework daily; translated at 10+ appointments; coordinated schedules so parent could work.”

### Arts example (output + audience)
- **Before (weak):** “Played violin in orchestra.”  
- **After (strong):** “Orchestra violin — section leader; performed 12 concerts/year; mentored 2 new players; arranged 3 pieces for school events.”

### A quick “field-aware” example (Common App)
If your **Position** already says “Founder,” your description can skip the obvious and go straight to proof.

- **Position/Leadership**: Founder & President  
- **Organization**: Peer Tutoring Program  
- **Description**: “Launched Algebra I bootcamp; trained 4 tutors; 12 students raised quiz avg 62→78; shared handouts w/ dept.”

<span id="red-flags"></span>
## Red flags that weaken entries (and quick fixes)

- **Vague verbs** (“helped,” “assisted,” “participated”).  
  **Fix**: swap in an ownership verb (built, led, coordinated, trained) *only if true*.

- **Titles without proof** (“Founder,” “President”) but no actions/outcomes.  
  **Fix**: add one action + one result (growth, adoption, money raised, output shipped, people served).

- **Impact claims with no credibility** (“changed my community,” “made a big difference”).  
  **Fix**: replace with concrete scope (who, how many, how often, what changed).

- **Padding or repetition** (restating hours, restating organization, restating role).  
  **Fix**: let the fields do their job; use the description for proof.

- **Trying to sound impressive instead of clear**.  
  **Fix**: write so a reader can paraphrase it in one sentence.

<span id="self-audit"></span>
## A fast self-audit (takes 3 minutes)

For your top 5 activities, ask:

- Can a reader tell **what I did** in 10 seconds?
- Did I show **at least one action** and **one outcome** (or scope) per entry?
- Does my list show **depth + variety** (not 10 versions of the same activity)?
- Do my descriptions sound **defensible** (nothing exaggerated or unverifiable)?

If any answer is “maybe,” you don’t need more words — you need clearer proof.
