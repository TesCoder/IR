If you’re choosing between Early Decision (ED), Early Action (EA), and Regular Decision (RD), the real question is **timing and tradeoffs**. Binding vs non-binding is only part of the story; the bigger lever is how each plan shapes your testing window, essay bandwidth, recommendation timing, and financial aid options.

This guide maps the calendar, shows how to pick the right plan, and gives you a week-by-week outline you can actually follow.

## What each round means in practice

- **ED (binding)**: Best for a true first-choice school with clear affordability. It increases clarity but removes leverage if aid is uncertain.  
- **EA (non-binding)**: Keeps options open and can deliver early feedback. Competitive EA pools still expect polish equivalent to ED.  
- **RD (non-binding)**: The longest runway, but often the most crowded pool. It’s your chance to refine essays and add context if junior spring was bumpy.

## How deadlines change your prep

**Testing:**  
- ED/EA deadlines (Oct–Nov) mean testing should be largely finished by early fall of senior year.  
- RD (Jan–Feb deadlines) allows a late-fall test, but stacking testing + essays is risky.

**Essays:**  
- ED/EA essays must be strong earlier; supplemental depth matters.  
- RD lets you iterate more, but only if you protect time in November/December.

**Financial aid:**  
- ED reduces comparison shopping. If aid is a major factor, run NPCs early and confirm how binding release works.  
- EA/RD keep negotiation leverage; still submit FAFSA/CSS early to avoid delays.

## Simple decision framework

Use three filters:

1) **Fit certainty:** You’ve visited (virtually or in-person), know the programs, and can explain “why here” beyond prestige.  
2) **Affordability clarity:** NPC shows a feasible number; family is comfortable with ED’s binding nature.  
3) **Readiness:** Testing, essays, and recommendations can be *finished* (not “almost done”) by the relevant deadline.

If any filter is weak, lean toward EA or RD for optionality.

## Month-by-month calendar (junior spring → senior winter)

- **Mar–Apr (jr year):** Take diagnostics; pick SAT or ACT; map major deadlines for top-choice schools.  
- **May–Jun:** Launch essays brainstorming; start recommenders list; schedule first official test if ready.  
- **Jul–Aug:** Draft personal statement + 1–2 supplements; take first or second official test; finalize activity list.  
- **Sep:** Finalize ED/EA essays; retake test if data supports it; confirm recommenders and transcripts.  
- **Oct–Nov (ED/EA window):** Submit ED/EA; track portals; prep RD supplements in parallel.  
- **Dec:** Receive ED/EA results; update strategy. If deferred/denied, polish RD essays and confirm testing scores to send.  
- **Jan–Feb (RD window):** Submit RD; maintain grades; prepare for interviews and scholarship steps.

## Week-by-week action plan (8-week sprint to ED/EA)

**Week 1–2:** Lock target schools and plans (ED vs EA vs RD). Outline personal statement + one key supplement.  
**Week 3–4:** Draft and revise personal statement; first full draft of ED/EA supplement; schedule recommenders.  
**Week 5–6:** Second pass on supplements; align testing (retake if data says +2–3 points is realistic); organize financial documents.  
**Week 7:** Final proof across essays; confirm portal setup; check transcript/reporting requirements.  
**Week 8:** Submit ED/EA; shift to RD backups (re-scope essays, update activity list with fall wins).

## How to choose the right plan for *you*

- **Clarity on first-choice:** If you can articulate academic/program fit and have confirmed affordability, ED is compelling.  
- **Optionality needed:** If aid or fit is uncertain, use EA where available, then RD.  
- **Late bloomers:** If junior spring grades were shaky but trending up, RD can showcase improvement; consider EA to demonstrate interest without locking in.

## Avoid these common mistakes

- **Stacking everything in October.** Spread testing earlier; don’t finalize essays the same week as your first EA deadline.  
- **Ignoring aid until after ED submit.** Run NPCs and read ED release policies before committing.  
- **Generic “why us.”** Name 2–3 specific academic + community ties (programs, labs, clinics, advising) that fit your goals.  
- **No retake window.** If data shows upside, schedule a retake with enough margin for score release before deadlines.

## Financial/aid considerations

- Use each school’s NPC; check if merit is available in ED.  
- Understand ED release conditions (aid gap, family change).  
- For EA/RD, submit FAFSA/CSS early; confirm scholarship deadlines (often earlier than RD).
