English proficiency requirements can feel confusing because different schools treat them differently:

- Some require TOEFL/IELTS for most international applicants
- Some offer waivers based on schooling language or years of instruction
- Some accept multiple tests and have different score expectations by program

The easiest way to avoid surprises is to plan early and treat English testing like part of your admissions calendar — not an afterthought.

This guide helps you choose TOEFL vs IELTS, set timing, and build a low-stress plan.

## Step 1: Confirm what your schools actually require

For each target school, confirm:

- Which tests are accepted (TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo English Test, etc.)
- Minimum required score (and whether certain sections matter more)
- Waiver rules (years of instruction in English, curriculum type, etc.)
- Deadline and score-report timing

Policies vary widely — don’t assume.

## TOEFL vs IELTS: how to choose

There isn’t one “better” test. Choose based on fit:

- **Format comfort**: TOEFL tends to be more computer-based; IELTS has variants and can feel more conversational in parts.
- **Strength profile**: some students perform better in one test’s speaking/writing style.
- **Availability**: test dates and locations can differ.
- **School acceptance**: if a key school prefers one test, don’t fight it.

If you’re unsure, take a short diagnostic for each and choose the one with the clearest improvement path.

## Timing: plan backwards from deadlines

A practical rule:

- Choose a test date that leaves room for a retake if needed.
- Build buffer for score reporting and any administrative delays.

If you’re applying in the fall/winter, late summer is often the latest “comfortable” window for most students — but your timeline depends on your school list.

## What to do if you’re close to the cutoff

If your score is just below a minimum:

- Retake only if practice data shows clear upside
- Focus prep on the sections that are constraining your score (often writing or speaking)
- Confirm whether the school enforces section minimums (some do)

## Common mistakes (and quick fixes)

- **Mistake: assuming your curriculum automatically grants a waiver.**  
  **Fix**: read each school’s waiver rules; request confirmation if unclear.

- **Mistake: testing too late.**  
  **Fix**: plan backwards and leave a retake window.

- **Mistake: ignoring program-level requirements.**  
  **Fix**: some majors/programs have higher expectations — confirm.
