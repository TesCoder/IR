English proficiency requirements vary widely. Some schools insist on TOEFL/IELTS, others grant waivers for English-medium schooling, and many accept alternatives like Duolingo. Plan early so testing is part of your admissions calendar, not a scramble.

## Which test do colleges accept?
- Confirm for each school: accepted tests (TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo), section minimums, superscore policy, and whether certain programs require higher scores.
- Note reporting timelines and preferred score-reporting methods (ETS codes, uploads).

## Score conversions and competitive benchmarks
| TOEFL iBT | IELTS |
| --- | --- |
| 80 | 6.5 |
| 90 | 7.0 |
| 100 | 7.5 |
| 105 | 8.0 |

- Highly selective programs often look for 100+ TOEFL or 7.5 IELTS, with solid writing/speaking subscores.
- Use your diagnostic results to pick the test with the clearer improvement path.

## Waiver eligibility — when you may not need a test
- Full-time study in English for X years (often 2–4) at an accredited institution.
- Degree program where the language of instruction is English (provide proof).
- AP/IB/A-level/T-level English scores that meet listed thresholds (school-specific).
- Always upload documentation; if unsure, request clarification before skipping a test.

## Test alternatives & timeline (Duolingo, institutional tests)
- If allowed, Duolingo can be a faster retake option; verify minimums and superscore rules.
- Institutional/bridge tests may satisfy conditional admission; confirm if they replace TOEFL/IELTS.
- Schedule early enough to allow one retake; back-plan from application deadlines.

## FAQ — quick answers
- **Q: Can I request a waiver?** A: Many colleges will waive if you studied full-time in English for X years. Upload proof and follow portal instructions.
- **Q: Do programs set higher scores?** A: Yes—business, nursing, and STEM often do. Check program pages.
- **Q: What if I’m below the cutoff?** A: Retake only if practice shows upside; target the weakest section and confirm whether section minimums apply.
