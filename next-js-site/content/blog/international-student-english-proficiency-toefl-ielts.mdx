English proficiency requirements vary widely. Some schools insist on TOEFL/IELTS, others grant waivers for English-medium schooling, and many accept alternatives like Duolingo. Plan early so testing is part of your admissions calendar, not a scramble.

Use this guide if you’re an international applicant (or a student with English as an additional language) figuring out which English proficiency test to submit—or whether you qualify for a waiver.

## Which test do colleges accept?
- Confirm for each school: accepted tests (TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo), section minimums, superscore policy, and whether certain programs require higher scores.
- Note reporting timelines and preferred score-reporting methods (ETS codes, uploads).

## Score conversions and competitive benchmarks
| TOEFL iBT | IELTS |
| --- | --- |
| 80 | 6.5 |
| 90 | 7.0 |
| 100 | 7.5 |
| 105 | 8.0 |

- Highly selective programs often look for 100+ TOEFL or 7.5 IELTS, with solid writing/speaking subscores.
- Use your diagnostic results to pick the test with the clearer improvement path.

## Waiver eligibility — when you may not need a test
- Full-time study in English for X years (often 2–4) at an accredited institution.
- Degree program where the language of instruction is English (provide proof).
- AP/IB/A-level/T-level English scores that meet listed thresholds (school-specific).
- Always upload documentation; if unsure, request clarification before skipping a test.

## TOEFL vs IELTS — which fits your profile?

If both tests are accepted at your target schools, use the signals below to pick the test with the clearer improvement path. Work through the table top-to-bottom; the first definitive match is your answer.

| Profile signal | Lean TOEFL iBT | Lean IELTS Academic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| School lists only one test | TOEFL is listed | IELTS is listed |
| Secondary curriculum | US-style, AP, IB | British, A-levels, IGCSE |
| Reading diagnostic (practice test) | Higher accuracy on long academic passages | Higher accuracy on shorter, varied-source passages |
| Listening comfort | North American lecture and campus-conversation format | Mixed-accent, shorter conversations and interviews |
| Retake timeline | MyBest Score (superscore across attempts) is useful; scheduling flexible | Need a result in 2–3 weeks; IELTS offers more frequent test dates |

If the table produces a tie, default to TOEFL: more U.S. schools list ETS codes in their portals, and MyBest Score reduces single-test-day risk.

## Test alternatives & timeline (Duolingo, institutional tests)
- If allowed, Duolingo can be a faster retake option; verify minimums and superscore rules.
- Institutional/bridge tests may satisfy conditional admission; confirm if they replace TOEFL/IELTS.
- Schedule early enough to allow one retake; back-plan from application deadlines.

## Ana's path: waiver check, test routing, and timeline

Ana is a Brazilian student applying to U.S. universities from an international school in São Paulo where all instruction has been in English — but she enrolled there in 10th grade, giving her two years of English-medium coursework before she applies in 12th grade.

**Step 1 — Waiver check**

Ana reviews each target school's waiver policy before assuming she's exempt:

- **UCLA:** Waiver granted if coursework at the secondary level was conducted entirely in English for at least three years. Ana has two years. Does not qualify.
- **University of Michigan:** Waiver granted if English was the primary language of instruction throughout secondary school. Ana's school switched to English in 10th grade, not from the beginning. Does not qualify.
- **NYU:** Waiver granted if the language of instruction was English for at least three years at the secondary level. Ana has two years. Does not qualify.

Result: no waiver. All three schools require a submitted test score.

**Step 2 — TOEFL vs IELTS routing**

Ana works through the routing table above:

- All three schools accept both TOEFL and IELTS → no automatic lean from school requirement.
- Her school follows the IB curriculum → slight lean toward IELTS, but not definitive.
- She takes a 30-minute TOEFL Academic Reading practice set (scores 87%) and an IELTS Academic Reading practice (scores 74%) — reading is her strongest section. → Lean TOEFL.
- TOEFL listening uses North American lecture and campus-conversation audio — familiar from IB English courses. → Lean TOEFL.
- She wants a retake option before her November 1 EA deadline and values MyBest Score as a safety net. → Lean TOEFL.

Decision: **TOEFL iBT.**

**Step 3 — Timeline**

Ana back-plans from November 1:

- **September:** Full-length TOEFL iBT practice test → baseline score 97. Identifies Reading (strong) and Speaking (needs work). Books two TOEFL dates.
- **October 3:** TOEFL iBT (first attempt). Target: 100+.
- **October 24:** TOEFL iBT (backup date, if needed). Scores released within 6–10 days → before November 1.
- **Score reporting:** ETS codes submitted at registration so scores route automatically.

Ana scores 102 on October 3 — above all three schools' 100 threshold. She cancels the October 24 backup and submits all three applications before November 1 with TOEFL 102 on file.

## FAQ — quick answers
- **Q: Can I request a waiver?** A: Many colleges will waive if you studied full-time in English for X years. Upload proof and follow portal instructions.
- **Q: Do programs set higher scores?** A: Yes—business, nursing, and STEM often do. Check program pages.
- **Q: What if I’m below the cutoff?** A: Retake only if practice shows upside; target the weakest section and confirm whether section minimums apply.
