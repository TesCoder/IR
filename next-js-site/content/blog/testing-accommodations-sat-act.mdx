Accommodations should remove barriers, not create new ones. The fastest way to secure SAT/ACT accommodations is to treat the process like an application: clear eligibility, organized evidence, and deadlines that leave room to fix surprises.

This guide walks you through eligibility, documentation, submission windows for College Board SSD vs ACT TAA, and what to do if you’re denied.

Use this guide if you’re a student (or parent) managing SAT or ACT testing with a disability, medical condition, or documented learning difference—whether you’re starting fresh or troubleshooting a denial.

## Who qualifies (and how it’s judged)

- **Eligibility hinges on functional impact**, not the diagnosis alone. Evaluators look for a history of need and classroom use.  
- **Recency matters:** neuropsych or psychoeducational evaluations typically need to be within 3–5 years.  
- **Consistency:** IEP/504/college disability services plans should align with the requested accommodations (extended time, separate room, readers, assistive tech).

## Documentation checklist

- Recent evaluation with scores and narrative (include processing speed/working memory for timing-related requests).  
- IEP/504/college accommodation letter showing classroom use.  
- Teacher/counselor statement connecting functional impact to testing tasks.  
- For medical/physical conditions: clinician letter detailing stability, flare patterns, and impact on timed exams.

## Timeline: SAT vs ACT (plan backwards from test date)

- **SAT (SSD):** submit 7+ weeks before the test date. Reuse approvals for future SAT/PSAT if unchanged.  
- **ACT (TAA):** submit 7–8+ weeks ahead; approvals are test-date specific, so plan for each administration.  
- **Retakes:** build in at least one retake window; don’t assume the first request will be perfect.

## How to submit (and avoid delays)

1. Create a College Board or ACT account and start the SSD/TAA request early.  
2. Coordinate with the school SSD/TAA coordinator; they can submit faster and verify existing plans.  
3. Upload complete documentation once, labeled clearly (evaluation, IEP/504, clinician letter).  
4. Track status weekly; respond quickly to clarification requests.  
5. If denied or partially approved, identify what was missing (recency, classroom usage, unclear functional impact) and resubmit.

## Applied example: Eli's Northwestern ED timeline

Eli is a rising senior with ADHD and a documented processing speed deficit. His 2022 neuropsychological evaluation placed his processing speed at the 14th percentile, and his school's 504 plan granted him 50% extended time in all timed classroom assessments. He wants to apply ED to Northwestern (November 1 deadline) and needs a SAT score in hand before or shortly after that date.

**What the ED deadline changed:** Northwestern's ED deadline is November 1, but supplemental documents—including test scores—can arrive after submission, typically by mid-November. That meant Eli's best option was the November 2 SAT. An October test date existed, but the SSD submission deadline for that window (7+ weeks out) fell in mid-August—too early given when Eli got organized. By targeting November 2, he had a realistic submission window. Before committing, he emailed Northwestern admissions and confirmed that score reports must arrive by November 15, which College Board's 10–14 day post-test release timeline made achievable.

**September — documentation assembly and submission (Steps 1–3):**

- **Week 1:** Eli and his parents met with the school's College Board SSD coordinator. The coordinator located Eli's 504 plan and confirmed the 2022 neuropsych evaluation was within the 3–5 year recency window. She agreed to co-submit through the school's SSD portal, which moves requests faster than a student submitting alone.
- **Week 2:** They assembled three documents: the 2022 neuropsych report (including processing speed subtest scores and a narrative explaining the functional impact on timed tasks), the current 504 plan with extended-time language, and a written statement from Eli's English teacher describing how processing speed affected his timed writing tasks in class. All three were uploaded in a single labeled batch—one submission, not multiple follow-up uploads.
- **Week 3 (September 15):** SSD request submitted—48 days before the November 2 test date, comfortably inside the 7+ week window.

**October — clarification, approval, and preparation (Steps 4–5):**

- **October 3:** Eli checked the College Board SSD portal and found a clarification request. The reviewer needed the 504 plan to explicitly name the SAT as a covered test—Eli's plan referenced "standardized assessments" generically. His school counselor added a one-sentence amendment to the 504 and resubmitted the same day.
- **October 10:** Full approval received—50% extended time and a separate testing room. Eli registered for the November 2 SAT that day. He also began four weeks of timed practice sections under 1.5× timing to recalibrate his pacing; the extra time would only help if he had practiced using it.
- **October 28:** Eli confirmed the testing center had a separate room available and verified how his timing would be administered section by section.

**November — test day and ED submission:**

- **November 1:** ED application submitted. SAT scores were still pending—Northwestern accepts scores that follow after submission. Eli used this time to finalize his essays without score pressure.
- **November 2:** Eli sat the SAT with 50% extended time in a separate room. Four weeks of paced practice had changed his experience: he completed Reading and Writing with time to spare, which was new for him.
- **November 13:** Score released. Eli sent the score report immediately through College Board's score-send portal. The report arrived at Northwestern before the November 15 window closed.

**What worked:** Eli's early September start was the operational difference. The October 3 clarification request cost seven days to resolve. If he had submitted in late September instead, that delay would have pushed the approval past the November 2 registration cutoff and eliminated his only ED-viable score window.

## Common accommodations and when to request them

- **Extended time (50%/100%)**: needs clear evidence of slow processing or output.  
- **Separate room/reduced distraction:** show attention/processing needs.  
- **Assistive technology (screen readers, speech-to-text, calculator for eligible conditions):** align with documented classroom use.  
- **Breaks/stop-the-clock:** document medical needs (blood sugar, migraine, POTS, etc.).

## Test-day logistics

- Bring approval letters and know exactly how your timing will be administered.  
- Confirm the test center’s capability (small rooms, technology).  
- Practice full-length sections using the approved timing so pacing changes don’t surprise you.  
- Have a backup plan if the center mishandles accommodations: document issues immediately and request a makeup.

## Appeals and fixes if you’re denied

- **If denied:** read the reason codes; address the specific gap (recency, missing classroom use, unclear linkage).  
- **If partially approved:** decide whether to accept and proceed, or fix and resubmit—do the math on timelines.  
- **If timing is tight:** prioritize the most impactful accommodation (often extended time) and secure that first; then expand for later dates if needed.

## Integrate testing with your admissions calendar

- For **ED/EA** targets, submit accommodation requests by early summer before senior year.  
- For **RD** only, you can push slightly later, but still allow a retake window.  
- Align prep with your approved timing; pacing under accommodations can change section strategy.
