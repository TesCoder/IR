Accommodations should remove barriers, not create new ones. The fastest way to secure SAT/ACT accommodations is to treat the process like an application: clear eligibility, organized evidence, and deadlines that leave room to fix surprises.

This guide walks you through eligibility, documentation, submission windows for College Board SSD vs ACT TAA, and what to do if you’re denied.

## Who qualifies (and how it’s judged)

- **Eligibility hinges on functional impact**, not the diagnosis alone. Evaluators look for a history of need and classroom use.  
- **Recency matters:** neuropsych or psychoeducational evaluations typically need to be within 3–5 years.  
- **Consistency:** IEP/504/college disability services plans should align with the requested accommodations (extended time, separate room, readers, assistive tech).

## Documentation checklist

- Recent evaluation with scores and narrative (include processing speed/working memory for timing-related requests).  
- IEP/504/college accommodation letter showing classroom use.  
- Teacher/counselor statement connecting functional impact to testing tasks.  
- For medical/physical conditions: clinician letter detailing stability, flare patterns, and impact on timed exams.

## Timeline: SAT vs ACT (plan backwards from test date)

- **SAT (SSD):** submit 7+ weeks before the test date. Reuse approvals for future SAT/PSAT if unchanged.  
- **ACT (TAA):** submit 7–8+ weeks ahead; approvals are test-date specific, so plan for each administration.  
- **Retakes:** build in at least one retake window; don’t assume the first request will be perfect.

## How to submit (and avoid delays)

1. Create a College Board or ACT account and start the SSD/TAA request early.  
2. Coordinate with the school SSD/TAA coordinator; they can submit faster and verify existing plans.  
3. Upload complete documentation once, labeled clearly (evaluation, IEP/504, clinician letter).  
4. Track status weekly; respond quickly to clarification requests.  
5. If denied or partially approved, identify what was missing (recency, classroom usage, unclear functional impact) and resubmit.

## Common accommodations and when to request them

- **Extended time (50%/100%)**: needs clear evidence of slow processing or output.  
- **Separate room/reduced distraction:** show attention/processing needs.  
- **Assistive technology (screen readers, speech-to-text, calculator for eligible conditions):** align with documented classroom use.  
- **Breaks/stop-the-clock:** document medical needs (blood sugar, migraine, POTS, etc.).

## Test-day logistics

- Bring approval letters and know exactly how your timing will be administered.  
- Confirm the test center’s capability (small rooms, technology).  
- Practice full-length sections using the approved timing so pacing changes don’t surprise you.  
- Have a backup plan if the center mishandles accommodations: document issues immediately and request a makeup.

## Appeals and fixes if you’re denied

- **If denied:** read the reason codes; address the specific gap (recency, missing classroom use, unclear linkage).  
- **If partially approved:** decide whether to accept and proceed, or fix and resubmit—do the math on timelines.  
- **If timing is tight:** prioritize the most impactful accommodation (often extended time) and secure that first; then expand for later dates if needed.

## Integrate testing with your admissions calendar

- For **ED/EA** targets, submit accommodation requests by early summer before senior year.  
- For **RD** only, you can push slightly later, but still allow a retake window.  
- Align prep with your approved timing; pacing under accommodations can change section strategy.
