“Passion project” has a branding problem.

Some students hear it and think it means “start a nonprofit.” Others think it means “post about an interest on Instagram.” Both usually fail for the same reason: **no scope, no ship date, and no proof.**

A strong passion project is simpler: **a real problem + a clear audience + a Version 1 you can launch + outcomes you can document.**

Use this guide to build something that’s credible (and sustainable), not just ambitious.

## What makes a passion project “work” in admissions

Admissions readers are not rewarding the idea. They’re rewarding evidence:

- You identified a problem you actually understand
- You took initiative and made decisions
- You shipped something real
- You can show results (even small ones) and learning

The most impressive projects are often the least glamorous — because they’re completed and measurable.

## The biggest mistake: projects that are too big

The fastest way to kill a project is to scope it like a company:

- “End food insecurity in my city.”
- “Create an app for mental health for teens.”
- “Start an international nonprofit.”

**Fix:** make it a Version 1 with a tight constraint:

- One school, one neighborhood, one partner organization
- One program format (workshop, tutoring block, event series, resource guide)
- One measurable outcome you can hit in 8–12 weeks

## A practical 8-week launch plan

### Week 1: Pick a problem you can define in one sentence
Write: “I’m solving ___ for ___ by ___.”

Example:
“Helping first-generation students at my school understand financial aid basics by running a 3-session workshop series.”

### Week 2: Choose your audience and distribution path
Great projects don’t fail because the work is bad. They fail because no one sees them.

Pick a distribution path:

- School partner (counselor, club, department)
- Community partner (library, nonprofit, clinic)
- Team channel (sports org, youth group)
- Online niche community (if you already have access)

### Week 3–4: Build Version 1 (fast)
Version 1 should be “good enough to use,” not perfect.

Possible Version 1 formats:

- Workshop + slides + attendance tracking
- Toolkit/guide + feedback form
- Tutoring sprint + pre/post assessment
- Event series + partner sign-off

### Week 5–6: Run it and iterate
Collect feedback and improve one thing each week:

- Clarity
- Participation
- Outcomes measurement
- Logistics

### Week 7: Package the proof
Don’t wait until application season. Create the evidence now:

- Before/after numbers
- Screenshots, sign-in sheets, materials
- Partner quote (one sentence is enough)

### Week 8: Write your “impact summary”
Write a 3–4 line summary you can reuse for activities bullets:

- What you built
- Who it served (scale)
- The outcome (metric)
- Your role (decision-making)

## What to measure (so the impact is real)

You don’t need viral growth. You need **a metric that matches the project**.

Good metrics include:

- People served (and how often)
- Attendance growth (week 1 → week 6)
- Dollars raised / resources delivered
- Pre/post improvement (quiz scores, completion rates)
- Adoption (how many people used your tool)

Bad metrics:

- “We posted awareness content.”
- “We had an account.”
- “We started a nonprofit.” (that’s a label, not an outcome)
