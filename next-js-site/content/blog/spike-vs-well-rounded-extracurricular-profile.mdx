“Do I need a spike?”

This question creates a lot of unnecessary stress, because students treat it like a binary: either you’re a spiky applicant or you’re not competitive.

In reality, most strong applicants win on something simpler: **a coherent profile** — activities that make sense together, show progression, and produce proof.

This guide helps you decide when focusing helps, when diversification helps, and how to avoid the most common problem: a long list that says the same thing seven times.

## What a “spike” actually means

A spike is not “one hobby.” It’s evidence of depth:

- Direction (clear interests)
- Skill development over time
- Increasing responsibility
- Outcomes you can document

You can have a spike in:

- Research / academic interest
- Arts / creative production
- Entrepreneurship / building
- Community impact
- Athletics
- A cause area you’ve worked on consistently

## What “well-rounded” should mean (and what it shouldn’t)

“Well-rounded” should not mean:

- Joining everything
- Collecting titles
- Having 10 activities with no outcomes

Healthy “well-rounded” looks like:

- 1–2 main themes (depth)
- 1–2 supporting commitments (balance)
- Optional: one short-term project you can ship

## When you should focus (go deeper)

Focus is usually the right move when:

- You have an activity where you can realistically grow into ownership/leadership
- You can create measurable outcomes in 8–12 weeks
- The activity aligns with your intended major or your story

Focus helps because it creates progression:
contributor → owner → leader → mentor.

## When you should diversify (strategically)

Diversifying can be smart when:

- Your main commitment is seasonal (sport, production, competition cycle)
- You need a second proof point in a different “mode” (academic + community, for example)
- Your current list is strong but too narrow to show how you’ll contribute on campus

The goal is not variety for its own sake. It’s *coverage*:
you want to show impact + curiosity + community contribution.

## The redundancy problem (how strong students accidentally weaken their profile)

Redundancy happens when you have multiple activities that all signal the same thing:

- 3 clubs with “member” roles and no outcomes
- Multiple volunteer roles with no ownership
- Repeating the same bullet language (“helped,” “assisted,” “participated”)

**Fix:** keep the activity with the strongest proof and cut or reframe the rest.

## A quick profile audit (10 minutes)

Write your activities in a list and label each with:

- **Theme** (what does it signal?)
- **Role level** (participant / owner / leader)
- **Proof** (numbers, artifacts, outcomes)

Then ask:

1. What are the 2–3 activities with the clearest outcomes?
2. Where is progression obvious (year-to-year growth)?
3. Which items are redundant or weak?
4. What’s missing: impact, leadership, academic depth, or sustained commitment?

Most students don’t need “more activities.” They need better packaging and proof.

## What to do if you don’t have a spike yet

You can still build one quickly by choosing a project with a ship date:

- A passion project with measurable milestones
- A leadership/operations role in an existing org
- A tutoring/workshop series with outcomes

Depth is built through action, not through waiting for the “perfect” interest to appear.
