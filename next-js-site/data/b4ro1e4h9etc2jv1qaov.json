    "testimonial_text": "As engineers, my wife and I thought we could handle our son’s applications, but we were stuck on how to make his passion for model rockets sound academic. Ivy Ready helped him connect propulsion physics to intellectual curiosity—the theme that tied everything together. His confidence grew, he owned his essays, and even presented at a local STEM fair. That focus and maturity, we believe, earned his full-tuition scholarship to USC.",

The drafts went from 850 words to 620 with concrete details about leadership and harmony. She was admitted to Harvard and the acceptance email felt earned because the application finally sounded like her.",
