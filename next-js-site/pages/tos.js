        Terms of Service
      </h1>
      <p>
        By using our service, you agree to abide by Ivy Ready&rsquo;s Terms of
        Service and additional guidelines agreed with the College Application
        Coach (if applicable) during the administration of a service. Note: In
        this Agreement the term <strong>You</strong> refers to both the Parent
        (legal guardian) and Applicant (student) unless specified.
      </p>
      <h2>Terms</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-10">
        <li>
          As the Parent (legal guardian), you acknowledge that you are signing
          this Agreement on behalf of yourself as well as the Applicant.
        </li>
        <li>
          You acknowledge that this Agreement takes effect on the above signed
          date and will terminate when the last college application essay is
          completed or on the last college application submission deadline for
          the list of target colleges, whichever comes first.
        </li>
        <li>
          You acknowledge that you will be working directly with the College
          Application Coach, an independent contractor, selected by you after
          reviewing the list of coaches and an introductory session.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Applicable to Hourly Consultation</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-10">
        <li>
          Hourly consultations are available on a first requested, first
          reserved basis.
        </li>
        <li>
          In hourly consultation, the coach may become unavailable and no longer
          able to continue supporting the student. In this instance, the family
          has an option to work with another coach or get a refund.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Refund Policy for Hourly Consultations</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-10">
        <li>Refund for unused hours is available anytime.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Applicable to Packages</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-10">
        <li>
          While there are no limits to the number of consultation hours in
          “all-inclusive” packages, you agree to abide by reasonable
          expectations for hours of support and response (ex. giving at least
          one business day for a general response from the Application Coach and
          two or more business days for an in-depth reply, essay review, or
          in-person discussion, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          You acknowledge that in Essays-Only Support and Comprehensive Support
          packages the Applicant is responsible for staying on track with the
          review and submission timeline.
        </li>
        <li>
          You acknowledge that in Comprehensive Support with Logistics package
          the Coach will be responsible for creating the timeline (by working
          with the Applicant), and conducting check ins and reminders. In
          addition, the coach will take care of administrative components tied
          to the application process (e.g. assemble a document with requirements
          and deadlines for the list of colleges selected.)
        </li>
        <li>
          You acknowledge that the Applicant will submit documents for
          edit/review and schedule meetings in a timely manner. If the applicant
          falls behind schedule, the Application Coach will do their best to get
          the Applicant back on track. However, you acknowledge, regardless of
          the package selected, the Applicant is ultimately responsible for
          staying on track to meet official college application deadlines and
          Ivy Ready is not liable for missed application deadlines.
        </li>
        <li>
          As admission decisions are not in the control of Ivy Ready or the
          Application Coach, you acknowledge that this Agreement and
          accompanying service payment(s) are solely for application support.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the unlikely event that the assigned Coach cannot complete a
          service due to an emergency (e.g. car accident,) you give Ivy Ready
          the right to continue delivering on this Agreement in one of two ways:
          1) by assigning a replacement coach or 2) if another coach is
          unavailable, by nullifying this Agreement with a prorated refund for
          the work completed and/or time spent by the original Coach.
        </li>
      </ul>

            <li>This 30-day period begins after you sign the agreement and complete your first meeting</li>
            <li>Time spent on introductory calls before signing doesn't count toward this 30-day window</li>
