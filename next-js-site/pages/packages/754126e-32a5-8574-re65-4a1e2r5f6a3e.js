          Once you sign up for a package and a set of schools, there is no limit to the hours of application support within that package. The student will have direct access to the coach to set up meetings and send essays for editing. Parents are also more than welcome to join meetings and be copied on correspondences. (On average, it takes 100-120 hours for a full admissions season.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Comprehensive Support and Comprehensive Support with Logistics include additional 6 hours of face-to-face college counseling per year as well as unlimited email counseling. These are generally utilized by families to supplement the high school college counselor.
