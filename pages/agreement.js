            <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
            By using our service, you agree to abide by Ivy Ready&apos;s Terms of Service and additional guidelines agreed with the College Application Coach (if applicable) during the administration of a service.
            Note: In this Agreement&nbsp;the term &quot;You&quot; refers to both the Parent (legal guardian) and Applicant (student) unless specified.
            Terms
            <ul data-rte-list="default">
              <li>
                As the Parent (legal guardian), you acknowledge that you are signing this Agreement on behalf of yourself as well as the Applicant.
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that this Agreement takes effect on the above signed date and will terminate when the last college application essay is completed or on the last college application submission deadline for the list of target colleges, whichever comes first.
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that you will be working directly with the College Application Coach, an independent contractor, selected by you after reviewing the list of coaches and an introductory session.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Applicable to Hourly Consultation
            <ul data-rte-list="default">
              <li>
                Hourly consultations are available on a first requested, first reserved basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                In hourly consultation, the coach may become unavailable and no longer able to continue supporting the student. In this instance, the family has an option to work with another coach or get a refund.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Refund Policy for Hourly Consultations
            <ul data-rte-list="default">
              <li>
                Refund for unused hours is available anytime.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Applicable to Packages
            <ul data-rte-list="default">
              <li>
                While there are no limits to the number of consultation hours in âall-inclusiveâ packages, you agree to abide by reasonable expectations for hours of support and response (ex. giving at least one business day for a general response from the Application Coach and two or more business days for an in-depth reply, essay review, or in-person discussion, etc.)
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that in Essays-Only Support and Comprehensive Support packages the Applicant is responsible for staying on track with the review and submission timeline.
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that in Comprehensive Support with Logistics package the Coach will be responsible for creating the timeline (by working with the Applicant), and conducting check ins and reminders. In addition, the coach will take care of administrative components tied to the application process (e.g. assemble a document with requirements and deadlines for the list of colleges selected.)
              </li>
              <li>
                You acknowledge that the Applicant will submit documents for edit/review and schedule meetings in a timely manner. If the applicant falls behind schedule, the Application Coach will do their best to get the Applicant back on track. However, you acknowledge, regardless of the package selected, the Applicant is ultimately responsible for staying on track to meet official college application deadlines and Ivy Ready is not liable for missed application deadlines.
              </li>
              <li>
                As admission decisions are not in the control of Ivy Ready or the Application Coach, you acknowledge that this Agreement and accompanying service payment(s) are solely for application support.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the unlikely event that the assigned Coach cannot complete a service due to an emergency (e.g. car accident,) you give Ivy Ready the right to continue delivering on this Agreement in one of two ways: 1) by assigning a replacement coach or 2) if another coach is unavailable, by nullifying this Agreement with a prorated refund for the work completed and/or time spent by the original Coach.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Refund Policy for Packages
            <ul data-rte-list="default">
              <li>
                Refunds are available within 30 days after the counsellor and student have entered into an agreement, the 30 days will begin after the first counseling meeting. Hours the College Application Coach has already worked with the student will be deducted from the total payment.
